    "# Components\n",
    "\n",
    "## Very Basic\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a `TSX` file for the component.\n",
    "   1. There should be a __function__ inside with the name of the component that returns TSX (HTML).\n",
    "   1. You should __default export__ that function.\n",
    "1. Use the component (eg. in `App.tsx`\n",
    "   1. You need to import (without curly braces) relative to the src folder with ./\n",
    "   1. Then use the component as if it's an HTML tag (with /)\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Data Binding\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Include parameters in the component's function prototype\n",
    "1. Use the parameters within `{}` in the component\n",
    "1. Pass the parameters as attributes in parent components\n",
    "   - use `{}` if it's a TS object\n",
    "1. Two-way binding (as in Angular) is done more manually\n",
    "   - eg. set `value` and `onChange` of form controls\n",
    "   \n",
    "The object passed to a component function wraps the attributes from the React element and is known as `props`.  React expects that you will treat props as __read-only__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in Angular, __data flows down__ and __events flow up__.\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Events\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use (properly cased) HTML handlers (which React remaps internally)\n",
    "   - eg. `onClick`\n",
    "1. For parent to child communication via custom events: \n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  accept a function as a parameter to a component (`onEdit={handleEdit}`)\n",
    "    1. call that function in the child, which will invoke the parent's passed-in handler\n",
    "1. JS (and thus TS) event behavior reminders:\n",
    "    1. Events will bubble up to parents even if handled (use `stopPropagation()` on a child to stop from going further to parents after\n",
    "    1. Use `preventDefault()` to prevent default form submission behavior\n",
    "    \n",
    "## State\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Functions that return TSX are called every time the rendering might need to change (eg. on click handlers)\n",
    "1. You can use `useState()` to maintain state between calls (see __React Library__ below).\n",
    "1. If two components need the same state, manage it in their parent and pass the values in\n",
    "   - remember it's not like Angular where you have static bindings of data properties\n",
    "1. Alternatively, you can use __redux__ or __React Context__\n",
    "   - redux is better when different components in the tree need the same state, so that you don't have to pass around a bunch of props all over the place\n",
    "   - React context solves a similar problem but has less boilerplate code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in redux `useEffect` and `useState` are known as __hooks__ and help with things like state management and lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create your own hook as follows:\n",
    "1. define a function (eg. `useSomething`) that returns some kind of object full of properties that can be decomposed\n",
    "1. inside the function, you can use other hooks like the ones mentioned above\n",
    "1. then you can use this to wrap a lot of the statefulness and lifecycle management of your components\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Components\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write classes for components, and this used to be the way to do it if you needed lifetime management and state, but now that hooks have been introduced, it's not longer the mainstream recommended way.\n",
    "\n",
    "React people prefer to write functions instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how the class syntax looks though:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class HelloWorld extends React.Component {\n",
    "  render() {\n",
    "    return <div className=\"container\">Hello Class Component</div>;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mount/Unmount\n",
    "\n",
    "A class component has similar lifecycle hooks to an Angular component, but a function component is different.  It mounts when added to the real DOM, and is still considered mounted when it is modified. It unmounts when removed from the DOM (eg. by conditional inclusion in parent).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Render Props\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the equivalent of __content projection__ in Angular.  There is no special framework or API for it - just include a __function variable in the props__ passed into a component, and then a parent can set that.  Call the function in the child component and have it __return an element__.  Alternatively, you could pass an element in as a prop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Higher-Order Components (HOCs)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the name for a technique where instead of returning an element, a function returns a function that returns an element.  This can give you the ability to dynamically determine things like which props to pass in, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also refer to a function that takes a function, where the higher-level function is itself a component."

    "Some Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - eg. `import React from 'react';`\n",
    "    - this used to be required in all component TSX files, but isn't anymore\n",
    "    - you still see it in tutorials that are either old or trying to be backward compatible\n",
    "  -  eg. `import {useState} from 'react';`\n",
    "     - the function `useState()` gets a state variable and function to set it for the component\n",
    "     - `const [myVar, setMyVar] = useState(10)`;\n",
    "       - this gets a state variable from React to use for this component, with initial value 10 if not present yet\n",
    "       - read from `myVar` and write by calling `setMyVar`\n",
    "       - `setMyVar()` can take the __new state__ or a __function that accepts old and returns new__\n",
    "       - you can call it as a generic method if needed (eg. `useState<MyClass[]>(MY_CLASS_INSTANCES);`\n",
    "     - the returned setter function updates the state __after rendering__\n",
    "       - the current value will not change when you read it again during the current iteration\n",
    "       - if you need the value to __update cumulatively__ during the same iteration, pass a __function__ to the setter\n",
    "          - functions passed to the setter are queued to run after the render, so they can build on each other\n",
    "       - in the case of __multiple calls__ to `useState()`, the order determines which variable you get\n",
    "         - it is therefore expected that you will call it the same # of times in the same order for the same component\n",
    "            - you are supposed to call it at the top - it won't work properly if you call in a loop or something like that\n",
    "     - NOTE: __redux__ is an alternative to this kind of state management\n",
    "  - eg. `import {useEffect} from 'react';`\n",
    "     - `useEffect(() => {...});` lets you queue up a lambda to get called after the component is rendered\n",
    "     - it gets called again each render/update cycle\n",
    "     - the point is things like updating the rendered DOM directly in code (eg. to set the page title or to start loading from a server after initial page load), etc.\n",
    "     - you can also pass state variables in the 2nd arg\n",
    "        - eg. `useEffect(fn, [var1, var2]);` which will run the effect only when var1 and var2 change\n",
    "     - you can pass `[]` to only run the effect after component mount\n",
    "     - you can __return a function__ from the function inside `useEffect()` to perform __cleanup__\n",
    "         - will be called on unmount\n",
    "         - eg. so you can __subscribe and unsubscribe__\n",
    "  - eg. `import {useRef} from 'react';`\n",
    "     - `const ref = useRef(0);`\n",
    "        - this gets a reference variable for the current component, initially set to 0\n",
    "        - you use `ref.current` to get the current value\n",
    "        - you can change the value by changing `ref.current`\n",
    "        - changing the value does not cause a re-render - it is a plain JS object\n",
    "           - eg. to store click count for logging to console\n",
    "        - JSX also has `ref` attributes on elements which you can set to a ref variable\n",
    "          - then your click handlers and such can use that variable to reference to the element\n",
    "  - eg. `import {SyntheticEvent} from 'react';`\n",
    "     - this is React's wrapper around events\n",
    "     - events are usually browser specific, so this wrapper makes it more generic/stable\n",
    "     - event handlers will be passed instances of this\n",
    "     - you can use `event.nativeEvent` to get the browser one\n",
    "     - the usual stuff like `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()` are implemented on `SyntheticEvent`\n",
    "  - eg. `import {memo} from 'react';`\n",
    "     - `const MemoizedMyComponent = memo(function MyComponent(props: any));`\n",
    "     - kind of like `OnPush` in Angular\n",
    "     - `memo` is a higher-level component that takes a component and doesn't re-render it unless the __props or state variables change__\n",
    "        - eg. if the parent is re-rendered, a memoized child won't be re-rendered\n",
    "     - the re-rendering is prevented by memoizing the return value of the component function based on the props\n",
    "        - for that to work, it must be a __pure function__ that returns the same result with the same props\n",
    "     - it is considered an optimization rather than a gaurantee, so you still may get re-rendered when you don't think you will (don't rely on not rendering for actual functionality)\n",
    "     - you can customize the comparison used to determine if the props are equal with a 2 input predicate in teh 2nd arg of `memo()`\n",
    "        - default comparison is via `Object.is()` on each field (not same as `===` or `==`)\n",
    "   - eg. `import {useContext, createContext} from 'react';`\n",
    "     - `const MyContext = createContext(defaultValue)` is meant to be used __globally_ to make a context variable\n",

    "     - `<MyContext.Provider value={someExpression}>` wraps a part of the component tree in a value for the context\n",

    "\n",
    "Shared state between components that are not in an immediate parent-child relationship, such as common fields used by various nodes throughout your component tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an in-memory store meant to replace having to wire a bunch of props all over the place just to facilitate sparsely shared state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- __State__ - read-only object tree representing all the shared state in the application\n",
    "- __Actions__ - dispatched to store to transform the state\n",
    "   - action objects have at least a __type__ field (which should be a string constant)\n",
    "   - often also have a __payload__ field which has whatever you want\n",
    "   - often created by a function (an __action creator__)\n",
    "- __Reducers__ - functions that return new state based on old state and action\n",
    "   - 2 params: state and action\n",
    "   - return value: new state\n",
    "   - typically a __switch statement__ with a default\n",
    "   - multiple reducers can be __composed__ into 1 reducer to separate concerns\n",
    "   - typically the same name as the state property modified\n",
    "- __Store__ - holds the state object\n",
    "   - state accessible via `getState()`\n",
    "   - state modified via `dispatch(action)`\n",
    "   - subscribe to changes via `subscribe(listener)`, which returns a function for unsubscribing\n",

    "      - function to run to active enhancements (like devtools extension)\n",

    "# Adding React to Existing Site\n",
    "\n",
    "This section was generated by ChatGPT 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating React into an existing website built with HTML and JavaScript can be done incrementally and doesn't require a complete rewrite of your existing codebase. Here's an idiomatic approach to add React to an existing site:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Include React Libraries\n",
    "First, you need to include React and ReactDOM libraries in your HTML. You can add them via CDN links in your `<head>` tag or before the closing `</body>` tag:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!-- React and ReactDOM (Make sure to use the correct version) -->\n",
    "<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js\"></script>\n",
    "<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js\"></script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Identify Parts to Convert\n",
    "Identify parts of your website that could benefit from React. It's often easier to start with isolated components like forms, navigation menus, or interactive widgets, rather than entire pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Create a Root Element\n",
    "In your HTML, create a root element where you want your React component to render. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div id=\"react-root\"></div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Write Your React Component\n",
    "Write your React component in a separate JavaScript file. This component will be rendered inside the root element you created. For example, create a file named `MyComponent.js`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n",
    "    render() {\n",
    "        return (\n",
    "            <div>Hello from React!</div>\n",
    "        );\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Render the Component\n",
    "Use `ReactDOM.render` to render your component inside the root element. You can include this in your `MyComponent.js` file or in a separate script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById('react-root'));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Load Your Component Script\n",
    "Include your component script in your HTML file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<script src=\"path/to/MyComponent.js\n",
    "\n",
    "\"></script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Babel for JSX (Optional)\n",
    "If you're using JSX in your React components (which is very common), you'll need to transpile it since browsers don't understand JSX natively. One way to do this for small projects or individual components is to use Babel's standalone build directly in the browser:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone@7.12.9/babel.min.js\"></script>\n",
    "<script type=\"text/babel\">\n",
    "    // Your JSX code here\n",
    "</script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is not recommended for production use due to performance impacts. For a production setup, you should precompile your JSX using a build tool like Webpack and Babel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: Gradually Expand\n",
    "Once you've successfully added your first React component, you can gradually start converting other parts of your website to React. This allows you to incrementally modernize your site without a full rewrite.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 9: Consider a Bundler for Larger Projects\n",
    "As you add more React components, you might want to consider setting up a module bundler like Webpack, along with Babel, to handle JSX compilation and improve performance. This setup is more complex but offers more flexibility and efficiency for larger applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "This step-by-step process allows you to start using React in an existing website with minimal disruption. It's ideal for gradually introducing React components into legacy projects or for enhancing parts of a website with interactive features. Remember, as your usage of React grows, so should your development setup, eventually moving towards a more robust build process with tools like Babel and Webpack."
