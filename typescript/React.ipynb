    "   1. You need to import (without curly braces) relative to the src folder with ./\n",
    "   1. Then use the component as if it's an HTML tag (with /)\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Data Binding\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Include parameters in the component's function prototype\n",
    "1. Use the parameters within `{}` in the component\n",
    "1. Pass the parameters as attributes in parent components\n",
    "   - use `{}` if it's a TS object\n",
    "1. Two-way binding (as in Angular) is done more manually\n",
    "   - eg. set `value` and `onChange` of form controls\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Events\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use (properly cased) HTML handlers (which React remaps internally)\n",
    "   - eg. `onClick`\n",
    "1. For parent to child communication via custom events: \n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  accept a function as a parameter to a component (`onEdit={handleEdit}`)\n",
    "    1. call that function in the child, which will invoke the parent's passed-in handler\n",
    "1. JS (and thus TS) event behavior reminders:\n",
    "    1. Events will bubble up to parents even if handled (use `stopPropagation()` on a child to stop from going further to parents after\n",
    "    1. Use `preventDefault()` to prevent default form submission behavior\n",
    "    \n",
    "## State\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Functions that return TSX are called every time the rendering might need to change (eg. on click handlers)\n",
    "1. You can use `useState()` to maintain state between calls (see __React Library__ below).\n",
    "1. Alternatively, you can use __redux__\n",

    "    - you still see it in tutorials that are either old or trying to be backward compatible\n",

    "     - NOTE: __redux__ is an alternative to this kind of state management\n",
    "  - eg. `import {useEffect} from 'react';`\n",

    "     - it gets called again each render/update cycle\n",
    "     - the point is things like updating the rendered DOM directly in code (eg. to set the page title or to start loading from a server after initial page load), etc.\n",
    "  - eg. `import {SyntheticEvent} from 'react';`\n",
    "     - this is React's wrapper around events\n",
