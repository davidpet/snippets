    "# Angular Concepts Brain Dump\n",
    "\n",
    "These are things I remember from working with Angular at Google that aren't always apparent in tutorials or snippets that I didn't want to forget over time. This is just a brain dump and should be explicitly fact checked to make sure I didn't remember anything wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A component instance variable must be **public** for the template to be able to reference it in **interpolation**.\n",
    "  - also, in the template, you **don't use `this`** for the component instance variables\n",
    "- If I remember correctly, a **directive** is basically a component without a template (behavior only). They are normally attached via attributes, but technically components could be as well (though that's less common).\n",
    "- The **selector** for a component is usually taken as meaning the element name that will become that component, but technically it works this way:\n",
    "  1. When the template is compiled, all tags and attributes are checked against either the HTML spec or the selectors from component and directive metadata.\n",
    "  2. Any that don't match one of those two things cause a compile error.\n",
    "  3. Selectors for components are used to determine which components and directives will be created on which elements.\n",
    "     - I don't remember if this happens at compile time or runtime. Some parts of components are static but some are dynamic, so maybe a little bit of both?\n",
    "  4. The tag that a directive or component is attached to is the **host** element and remains in the DOM. Anything added by the directive or component, such as classes added in the metadata in TypeScript, or a template added by a component, is added to the DOM under the host element.\n",
    "- **Style encapsulation** means that styles applied to one component don't leak into others. If I remember correctly, in a normal debug build, this is accomplished by adding special classes to all the style selectors and to the host element. In a minified/optimized build, it uses the shadow DOM (the details of which I have forgotten). It is configurable which kind to use when.\n",
    "  - `::ng-deep` is a keyword you can put in front of a selector in your style for a component to turn off encapsulation for that selector. It is usually not recommended, but there are some cases where it can't be avoided.\n",
    "    - eg. You generate a popup window that you need to style. Since it isn't part of the DOM tree of the component, you can't use style encapsulation.\n",
    "  - `::ng-host` is another useful css keyword for applying stylings to the component's element itself instead of having to search children\n",
    "    - eg. so that you can do `display: block` for the top-level element in a component\n",
    "  - you can apply styles in the **global styles** for the app and then no encapsulation will be applied to them. If you want to be more selective about where global styles get applied, you can add your own classes inside templates that are aimed at the global styles.\n",
    "- **Rendering** of an Angular app is done via JS code generated by the compiler. Even though component templates look like HTML, they get compiled into JS (which actually builds the page more efficiently than pure HTML). The JS executes when the page is loaded and creates the DOM, which looks similar to the templates but with the dynamic stuff replaced by real stuff.\n",
    "- **Boostrapping** is the process of running the Angular app in the page. The JS code generated by the angular compiler needs to be included via a \\<script\\> tag on an html page in order to run the app in a browser. In the past I saw this done by creating an index.html that wasn't part of the build, and including a script tag to bring in the output JS. Looking at the newer generated skeleton projects, this seems to be done slightly differently now.\n",
    "  - I would imagine it's still pretty flexible because you may want to serve your JS code via a CDN, etc.\n",
    "- **Unit tests** are in Jasmine syntax (describe, it, spyOn), run by Karma. There's also Protractor, which I do not have experience with. Screendiff and integration testing (eg. CUJs) can be done via **Selenium**. I have experience with that but in a way that is not applicable to the real world, so I still need to learn the real world way.\n",
    "  - **matchers** are functions that return something that jasmine can use to decide if an object returned by a test maches a condition. You can use the built-in matchers like toEqual(), or import other matchers from libraries, or make them yourselves. Somehow, it ends up so that you can use matchers as functions in-place in some calls (like .toBeCalledWith(any(Object)), or use them in expect() statements `expect(bla).toBe(5)` (uses toBe matcher). I don't remember the exact mechanism here - presumably matchers are somehow decorated or declared somewhere that jasmine looks for and added to the prototype of some object returned by expect()?\n",
    "- **Dependency injection** lets you get things like **services** (which are just classes that you mark as injectable and can assume are singletons) as members of component classes by adding them as constructor args. Angular constructs components instead of you, and it knows how to inject based on its configuration. You would usually configure a service to be injectable forRoot, but it's possible to do more complicated configuration such as matching tokens (eg. if need to inject multiple variations of the same type of thing). This is done via modules.\n",
    "- **Modules** are the way Angular is configured to understand new tags (via components included in module), pipes, injectable objects, etc. Modules import other modules, declare components, export components, etc. **CommonModule** is the one that adds basic Angular stuff like (click), \\*ngFor, etc. although for some reason that is not present in the default app and it still works.\n",
    "- [] is for **dynamic binding** in general (attribute set at runtime based on TS code in quotes)\n",
    "  - it can be used for any attribute (I think)\n",
    "    - even attributes that are used as selectors for **directives** are ok to set dynamically with []\n",
    "  - it can be used to set a class with [class.classname]\n",
    "  - it can be used to set an attribute with [attr.attributename]\n",
    "  - it can be used to set an input on a component (the most common way you'll see it\n",
    "  - if you just need to pass a literal string, don't use [], because that will force you to nest quotes for no reason\n",
    "- () is for **event binding** in general\n",
    "  - it is used to execute the TS code in quotes when an event triggers\n",
    "  - generally the event is either built into Angular (like 'click' on buttons) or is an `@Output()` of a component\n",
    "  - from the perspective of the code that executes on an event, the `$event` value gets set in the TS code that runs and you can pass that to a TS method call if needed\n",
    "  - when you define your own event via @Output(), you are defining an observable, and the emitted values become $event one by one on anyone using () to bind to them\n",
    "- `[(ngModel)]` (\"banana in a box\") is for **two-way-binding** where updating the form field will update the variable bound to it and vice versa (without infinite recursion happening)\n",
    "  - If I recall correctly (though I'm mostly thinking of Dart I think), this kind of syntax in general means you're binnding to an input and output that happen to have the same name at the same time, and they each are implemented in the directive/component to receive inputs and send outputs correctly while updating internal state\n",
    "  - although contrary to that, I've seen somewhere else that it literally takes what you put in quotes and adds = to it, so maybe I'm wrong\n",
    "- template TS syntax (eg. in {{ }} for interpolation or in a [] or () expression) is a subset of TS\n",
    "  - generally can be an expression that returns a value, when applicable\n",
    "  - doesn't need to end with ;\n",
    "  - can use ; to separate multiple statements though\n",
    "- the **JS event loop** can't continue on to the next thing until your TS code completely returns from whatever it was handling\n",
    "  - so if you change an input to a component and then read something else on the component before returning from a click handler, change detection has had no time to run yet\n",
    "  - You can inject `ChangeDetectorRef` and run `detectChanges()` if you want to do an inline change detection change without returning back to the queue\n",
    "  - You can also use `markForCheck()` to make sure it runs change detection on something you changed (in a way that Angular won't see), but this will run on the next ordinary change detection run (eg. from the event queue)\n",
    "- **Schematics** are a way to customize templated generation of files, such as components in your team's style, etc.\n",
    "  - I don't remember the low-level details, but you configure somewhere that when you run a command like `ng generate [something]`, the `[something]` part is a schematic (I think)\n",
    "- **source maps** are for allowing chrome devtools or another debugger to link the browser's JS code with your TS code\n",
    "  - similar in concept to C++ symbols\n"

    "### On Component\n",
    "\n",

    "#### ngForm\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Ngform looks for all form controls under it and uses their `name` attributes to build an internal representation of the form state. It also understands that button of type _submit_ will submit the form (trigger the ngSubmit event). Note that HTML `<label>` attributes look at `id` instead of `name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ngModel\n",
    "\n",

    "Note that using two-way binding does not depend on being inside a form tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation is happening all the time (after a user enters some input for instance). It is not directly tied to submission. For instance, if a field is empty and you have a `required` tag (from HTML spec, not from Angular) on the field, the control's `valid` property will be false, and so will the overall form.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways you can react to the validity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. via the `valid` properties of NgModel and NgForm.\n",
    "2. via `ng-*` css classes (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in HTML form validation is disabled via `novalidate` on the form directive. This can be configured if needed. Angular replaces the built-in validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "A button that is marked as type `submit` will submit the form. All that means is that the state is changed to `submitted`. You have to listen for the event and do something useful with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CSS Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "NgForm adds css classes to the `<form>` and to child controls so that you can style them based on the validation state and such.\n",

    "### Reactive Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Contrast to Template-Driven Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "Template-driven forms take the html template as the source of truth and communicate with TS via two-way binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reactive forms have a model (officially called the **form model**) inside the TS of a component as the source of truth, and the template is configured to bind to that. Reactive forms deal more with **observables**, **interfaces**, etc. It is technically possible (but confusing and a bad idea) to mix the two approaches since they use a common infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Reactive Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "- immutability of objects (as opposed to two-way binding) = cleaner\n",
    "- more efficient change detection (due to the above)\n",
    "  - and don't have to trigger change detection as many times in tests because of how it works\n",
    "- more scalable and dynamic\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages of Reactive Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "- not as straightforward for simple cases (eg. a handful of control doing a simple input form)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parts that are the Same\n",
    "\n",
    "Reactive forms and template-driven forms are the same in terms of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CSS classes** like ng-valid\n",
    "  - CAVEAT: if you style using the 'required' attribute, but you specify the attribute in the model, it won't work\n",
    "    - to fix that, add a 'required' class in the template or something like that\n",
    "- **testing** is mostly the same (finding controls in the DOM and sending events, etc.)\n",
    "  - but you may not need to call fixture.detectchanges() and/or fixture.whenStable() so many times\n",
    "- **submitting** works the same (button with 'submit' style and ngSubmit event)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resetting Form\n",
    "\n",
    "A nullable field will reset to `null` instead of the initial value on `formGroup.reset()`. This can be counterintuitive. You can also make it **non-nullable** to prevent that from happening (shown in the commits below).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "You create `FormControl` instances in code, and group them with `FormGroup` and `FormArray` as needed to create a model of the form. Rather than binding html form controls to objects in the template, you bind to names. The names match keys of model objects in code. You just need 1 top-level form group bound to the whole model in code, and then the child elements will find their place in the model tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use methods of the model objects like `setValue()` and subscribe to the value changes as an observable, catching changes that happen either in code or in the UI. All this is shown in the commits below.\n"

    "\n",
    "After implementing the interface, then you can use the component in a template and use a directive like `formControlName` to bind it to a form control in the model (for reactive forms). You could use it similarly to an element like input (ngModel, etc.) in a template-driven form.\n"

    "## Change Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When a triggering event occurs (user interaction event, observable emitting, http request completing, setTimeout lambda being called, etc.), run change detection process at top of tree (eg. parent component).\n",
    "   - note that change detection runs **after the handlers** for events, so that you can change bindings in event handlers and have them reflect right away\n",
    "2. Check parent component for input binding changes or field changes. The exact checking depends on which strategy the component is configured to use.\n",
    "3. If any relevant change is found, mark the component dirty and check its children using their strategies, and so on.\n",
    "4. Call ngOnChanges for dirty components.\n",
    "5. Re-render dirty components (presumably from the bottom up).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Default** strategy will check all input bindings and member variables in a value-comparing way\n",
    "  - if a field in an object (even if nested) or an array value is changed, it will see it\n",
    "  - this is the most expensive but allows for full mutability of data\n",
    "- **OnPush** strategy will only check for certain kinds of changes to input bindings and member variables\n",
    "  - essentially it will do an ===\n",
    "    - which means primitives will be value compared, but objects and arrays will be referenced compared\n",
    "  - much less expensive\n",
    "  - encourages immutability which is cleaner\n",
    "\n",
    "### Triggering Default-style Change Detection With OnPush\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change the object reference of an input binding of the component to be triggered by using the **slice operator** to copy the object (eg. you could use a **getter** to make this transparent and use immuatable style).\n",
    "2. Inject `ChangeDetectorRef` and call `markForCheck()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ngOnChanges\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, ngOnChanges is supposed to hook all change detection dirtiness, but in my testing, it only detects what OnPush change detection would pick up, even if you're using default. Thus, you can see a lot of re-renders that are not signaleld by ngOnChanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "ngOnChanges runs in between checking for dirtiness and updating the view.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parent-Child Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Change detection normally flows down from the root component and only checks children whose parents have been marked dirty. However, it is still possible for children to be dirty when their parents aren't, such as when using `markForCheck()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a parent has OnPush, that may restrict when the child gets to run based on changes to the parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ChangeDetectorRef\n",
    "\n",
    "You can inject ChangeDetectorRef in your component and call methods to manage change detection for the component.\n",
    "\n",
    "`markForCheck()` will cause a component to be checked for changes using the **Default** strategy (even if it's an OnPush component) regardless of the parent status. It can be used for the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if the code has to make a change to a property of an object and OnPush is being used\n",
    "  - an alternative to doing this would be to use slicing to copy the object so that its reference is different\n",
    "- if some async code such as an http call or observable needs to change the state of the object independently of any bindings from the parent\n",
    "\n",
    "`detectChanges()` manually triggers the whole change detection process on a component and its children. It is used in conjunction with `detatch()` to take full control over when change detection occurs, such as when change detection is very expensive for a component and you want to make it happen at certain intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "In JS (and thus TS), you can patch any symbol with your own version and call the original as a wrapper. There is a library called **Zone.js** that does this for Angular. It wraps all the major event handlers so that the originals still happen but with Angular also doing its own stuff such as change detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "A side effect of this is that APIs that aren't known to Zone.js will not trigger change detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that because of the way it's designed, there are **no cycles**. A binding change may cause a view change, but it won't feedback and cause more binding changes. Two-way binding in forms is designed to not cause a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is an **injectable service** called **NgZone** that can be used to run code that is not in the Angular zone inside the Angular zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "`this.ngZone.run(() => { this.button.click(); });`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is usuaully used for handlers for 3rd party asynchronous libraries. You may have to run `changeDetectorRef.detectChanges()` within the same handler depending on the situation.\n"

    "## Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "When your server receives a request on a URL, the **server-side** needs to know that paths under your app should all get served with the angular app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then once the client code loads the Angular app in the browser, the portion of the URL that looks like a subpath of the app can be read via JavaScript by Angular internally. This information is not used until it is needed - otherwise the app and components load as normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is a `router-outlet` tag in one of your templates, then the routing information gets used. The url is matched against routing paths in order until one matches, and then a component is loaded after the router-outlet.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user **manually** changes the url in the address bar, it's like starting over (whole app **reloaded**, but with the correct routes).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the url is changed from within the app (eg. via a button w/ `routerLink` or via `router.navigate()`), the component is switched out without reloading the app. If the component doesn't need to be changed but an input does (eg. id in the url), the component can listen to an observable to react to the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: if you ever need a custom url matcher, check this example out: https://angular.io/guide/routing-with-urlmatcher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, routing is done in **separate modules** and imported into app modules. An example is to have a module for the main app routing and then other modules imported by that module for individual features within the app. Routing modules tend to be parallel to feature modules. Routing can be relative to features (see the tutorial commits below).\n",
