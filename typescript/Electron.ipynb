    "\n",
    " - open-source framework for desktop apps built using web technology (TypeScript, HTML, CSS)\n",

    " - developed by OpenJS Foundation\n",
    " - VSCode is built on it"

    "## Entry Point\n",
    "\n",
    " - the `main` field in `package.json` tells many frameworks, including Electron, where to start from\n",
    " - when you run `electron .`, electron will search the current folder for `main` from `package.json` and run it as a GUI app\n",
    "   - if the script does nothing, it will have nothing to show\n",
    " - default if not configured is `index.js`\n",
    " - create an __npm script__ (eg. `start`) to run `electron .`"

    "## Program Structure\n",
    "\n",
    " - global `app` object from `electron` package can be used to hook into the lifecycle\n",
    " - `app.whenReady()` returns a promise to run when the app is ready to run (good place to start)\n",
    " - `BrowserWindow` from `electron` package is object you can create and then load HTML files with\n",
    " - use `app.on()` to listen for other events\n",
    " - use `app.quit()` to end the program\n",
    " - overeall, the `main process` is like the browser (which you can extend and customize as a desktop app), and it loads HTML files, which are like the static HTML files you usually ignore in React and Angular apps (though you don't have to)\n",
    "   - you can run bundles from React, etc. from these HTML files\n",
    " \n",
    " ## Lifecycle\n",
    " \n",
    " - `app.whenReady()` as described above\n",
    " - `app.on('window-all-closed')` for when all windows of the app are closed\n",
    " - `app.on('activate')` for when the app is focused (even if no windows)\n",
    " \n",
    " ## BrowserWindow\n",
    " \n",
    " - `loadFile(filename)` to load an HTML file\n",
    " - `getAllWindows()` to get the open windows as an array (check length if need number)\n",
    " \n",
    "## System-Specific Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    " - use Node's `process.platform` to determine which system(s) you are on\n",
    "  - eg. `darwin` if __MacOS__\n",
    " - when __all windows are closed__:\n",
    "   - on Windows and Linux, close the app with `app.quit()`\n",
    "   - on MacOS, create a new window on app activation\n",
    "     - you can rely on `activate` not getting called for the other platforms if exit right away\n",
    "     \n",
    "## DOM\n",
    "\n",
    " - the __main process__ (entry point script) has no access to the DOM\n",
    "   - because the DOM is in a __separate process__ called the __renderer__\n",
    " - to run code in the DOM of an HTML page before it renders, do the following:\n",
    "   1. Create a JS file to be run in that context standalone\n",
    "   1. In that script, subscribe to an event like `DOMContentLoaded`\n",
    "   1. Compute the absolute path to the script using Node as in the __quickstart tutorial__\n",
    "      - relies on some imports from `path` and `url` node libraries\n",
    "   1. Add `webPreferences.preload` field to the 3rd param of your `BrowserWindow` constructor\n",
    " - to run any script code you want in the DOM, do the following:\n",
    "   - add a `<script>` tag in the HTML file pointing to a JS bundle\n",
    "   - build that JS bundle with Webpack, etc.\n",
    "     - then you can use whatever technology you want, such as React, just like with normal web apps"

    "1. Install the typescript dependencies to the project (as shown in Dependencies above)\n",

    "      \"compilerOptions\": {\n",
    "        \"target\": \"ESNext\",\n",
    "        \"module\": \"es2020\",\n",

    "1. Move your JS files into the `src` folder and change the extension to `.ts` (plus any code changes inside)\n",
    "1. In `package.json`, change `main` to `dist/main.js`, add a `build` script that calls `tsc`, and add `npm run build &&` to the front of the `start` script (for instance)\n",
    "1. Any place that references JS files will need to reference them from the appropriate new place\n",
    "   - usually `dist/thefile.js` to get the build outputs from `tsc`\n",
    "   - but the code to get the absolute path of the current script will automatically know it's in `dist` because that's where the main JS is running from"

    "## Using React, Angular, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "1. The __main process__ will still be in TS or JS and still needs to load a main HTML file\n",
    "1. The main HTML file still needs to include the bundled script, just like always\n",
    "1. You handle the react building/bundling (eg. via WebPack) in your `package.json` scripts as usual\n",
    "\n",
    "It works basically like a normal statically built app except you have an additional script that loads the top-level HTML, which references JS files that should have been made by the build process before electron runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: that means your React or Angular app could work as a web app as well as the electron app.  You just won't have any of the stuff that runs in the main process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build from scratch:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by creating an Angular or React app for the in-browser part as normal for the web framework you're using\n",
    "1. Install `electron` to the project and add/modify `package.json` scripts to use electron to run a new top-level TS file (`main.ts`) which will load the HTML file that is the entry point to the app"
