    "# All Ways of Quoting\n",

    "- SQL supports various ways of quoting strings, allowing flexibility in representing string literals.\n",
    "- Single quotes (`'`) are the most commonly used way to quote strings in SQL.\n",
    "- Double quotes (`\"`) can also be used to quote strings, although they are less commonly used and may require enabling certain settings in some database systems.\n",
    "- Square brackets (`[]`) are used to quote identifiers, such as table or column names, in SQL Server and some other database systems.\n",
    "- Backticks (`` ` ``) are used to quote identifiers in MySQL.\n",
    "- Quoted identifiers (double quotes) are used to preserve case sensitivity or to use reserved words as identifiers in ANSI SQL.\n",
    "- String concatenation can be performed using the `+` operator.\n",
    "- Quotes can be escaped within a quoted string by doubling them up.\n",
    "- Unicode strings can be represented using the `N` prefix before the string literal.\n",

    "# Variables\n",

    "In SQL, variables are used to store and manipulate data within a script or a batch of statements. The `DECLARE` keyword is used to declare a variable, specifying its name and data type. The `SET` keyword is used to assign a value to a variable. Variables can be used in various SQL statements, such as `PRINT` and `SELECT`, to display or manipulate data.\n",

    "Next, we declare and assign a value to a variable `@anotherVariable` in a single statement. We print the value of `@anotherVariable` using the `PRINT` statement.\n",
