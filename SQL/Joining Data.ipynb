    "CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of two tables, which means it combines each row from the first table with every row from the second table. In the example, it combines the \"Employees\" table with the \"Departments\" table, resulting in a new table with all possible combinations of employees and departments.\n",

In the example, it joins the \"Employees\" table with itself based on the condition that the EmployeeID of the first employee should not be equal to the EmployeeID of the second employee. This results in a table that shows all possible combinations of employees.\n",
    "\n",
