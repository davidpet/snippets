    "# SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "This code snippet demonstrates the basic SQL statements: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. It starts by creating a table called \"employees\" with columns for id, name, age, and salary. Then, it inserts some sample data into the table. \n",
    "\n",
    "The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from the table. It shows examples of selecting all rows and specific columns, as well as filtering rows based on a condition using the WHERE clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UPDATE statement is used to modify the data in a specific row. In this case, it updates the salary of an employee with id 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DELETE statement is used to remove a row from the table. In this case, it deletes the employee with id 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the SELECT statement is used again to show the remaining rows in the table after the update and delete operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These basic SQL statements are fundamental for interacting with databases and manipulating data."
