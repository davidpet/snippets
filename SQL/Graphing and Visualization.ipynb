    "# Basics of Graphing Tools\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "This code snippet demonstrates the basics of working with graph data in SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, a table called `graph_data` is created with columns for `id`, `node`, and `edge`. This table will store the graph data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample data is then inserted into the table using the `INSERT INTO` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph data can be queried using the `SELECT` statement. The first query retrieves all rows from the `graph_data` table. The second and third queries demonstrate filtering the data based on a specific edge or node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph data can also be updated using the `UPDATE` statement. In this example, the edge value for the row with `id = 4` is changed to 'F'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rows can be deleted from the graph data using the `DELETE` statement. In this example, the row with `id = 3` is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of rows in the graph data can be counted using the `COUNT` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the table is dropped using the `DROP TABLE` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "id | node | edge\n",
    "---+------+-----\n",
    "1  | A    | B\n",

    "# Integrating with Visualization Software\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "This code snippet demonstrates how to integrate SQL with visualization software by creating a table, inserting data, and querying the data for visualization purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code, we first create a table called \"sales\" with columns for \"id\", \"product\", and \"revenue\". We then insert sample data into the table using the INSERT INTO statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we perform several queries on the \"sales\" table to retrieve data for visualization. The first query selects the \"product\" and \"revenue\" columns from the \"sales\" table. The second query calculates the average revenue using the AVG function. The third query calculates the maximum revenue using the MAX function. Finally, the fourth query calculates the minimum revenue using the MIN function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each query is executed separately and the results are printed to demonstrate the features. The expected output will vary depending on the data inserted into the \"sales\" table."
