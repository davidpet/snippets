    "# Normalization\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "This code snippet demonstrates the concept of normalization in database design using SQL. Normalization is a process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code creates several tables to illustrate different levels of normalization. Here's a breakdown of the tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customers table: Stores customer information such as customer_id, customer_name, customer_email, and customer_phone.\n",
    "2. Orders table: Stores order information including order_id, customer_id (foreign key referencing Customers table), order_date, and order_total.\n",
    "3. OrderItems table: Stores individual order items with order_item_id, order_id (foreign key referencing Orders table), product_id (foreign key referencing Products table), quantity, and price.\n",
    "4. Products table: Stores product information with product_id, product_name, category_id (foreign key referencing Categories table), and category_name.\n",
    "5. Categories table: Stores category information with category_id, category_name, and category_description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample data is then inserted into the tables to demonstrate the relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a query is executed to retrieve customer information along with their orders and order items using JOIN statements to link the tables together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the query will display the customer name, order details, order item details, product name, quantity, and price for each customer."

    "# Denormalization\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In this code snippet, we demonstrate the concept of denormalization in database design using SQL. Denormalization is the process of combining normalized tables into a single table to improve query performance by reducing the number of joins required.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by creating three tables: `customers`, `orders`, and `order_items`. The `customers` table stores customer information, the `orders` table stores order information, and the `order_items` table stores order item details.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate denormalization, we denormalize the tables by combining the necessary information into a single query. The query retrieves order details along with customer information by joining the `orders`, `customers`, and `order_items` tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the query will include columns from all three tables, providing a denormalized view of the data. This denormalized structure eliminates the need for multiple joins when querying the data, improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Output:\n",
    "```\n",
