    "# Built-in Functions (e.g., Date functions, String functions)\n",
    "This code snippet demonstrates various built-in functions in SQL for working with dates and strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For date functions, it shows how to get the current date, time, and timestamp using `CURRENT_DATE`, `CURRENT_TIME`, and `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` respectively. It also demonstrates extracting year, month, and day from a date using `EXTRACT`, calculating the difference between two dates using `DATEDIFF`, and formatting dates using `TO_CHAR`.\n",

    "For string functions, it shows how to get the length of a string using `LENGTH`, convert a string to uppercase or lowercase using `UPPER` and `LOWER`, concatenate two strings using `CONCAT`, replace a substring in a string using `REPLACE`, trim leading and trailing spaces from a string using `TRIM`, get the position of a substring in a string using `POSITION`, repeat a string a specified number of times using `REPEAT`, and reverse a string using `REVERSE`. It also demonstrates converting a string to a date or timestamp using `TO_DATE` and `TO_TIMESTAMP`.\n",

    "# Sequences (for generating unique numbers)\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In SQL, sequences are used to generate unique numbers. They are often used to generate primary key values for tables. The code snippet demonstrates various aspects of working with sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first step is to create a sequence using the `CREATE SEQUENCE` statement. In this case, a sequence named `my_sequence` is created without any parameters.\n",
    "- To get the next value from the sequence, the `NEXTVAL` function is used. It returns the next value in the sequence. In the example, `NEXTVAL('my_sequence')` is used, which will return `1` as the initial value.\n",
    "- Sequences can also be created with parameters such as initial value and increment. The `CREATE SEQUENCE` statement can be used with the `START WITH` and `INCREMENT BY` clauses to specify these parameters. In the code snippet, a sequence named `my_sequence_with_params` is created with an initial value of `100` and an increment of `10`.\n",
    "- The `NEXTVAL` function can be used with sequences that have parameters as well. In the example, `NEXTVAL('my_sequence_with_params')` is used to get the next value from the sequence, which will be `100` initially and `110` in the subsequent call.\n",
    "- The `SETVAL` function is used to set the current value of a sequence. In the code snippet, `SETVAL('my_sequence_with_params', 200)` is used to set the current value of `my_sequence_with_params` to `200`.\n",
    "- The `CURRVAL` function is used to get the current value of a sequence. In the example, `CURRVAL('my_sequence_with_params')` is used to retrieve the current value, which will be `210` after setting it using `SETVAL`.\n",
    "- Sequences can be restarted using the `RESTART IDENTITY` clause. In the code snippet, `RESTART IDENTITY('my_sequence_with_params')` is used to restart the sequence `my_sequence_with_params`.\n",
    "- After restarting the sequence, the `NEXTVAL` function is used again to get the next value, which will be `100` as specified by the `START WITH` clause.\n",
    "- Finally, the sequence can be dropped using the `DROP SEQUENCE` statement. In the example, `DROP SEQUENCE my_sequence_with_params` is used to remove the sequence `my_sequence_with_params` from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequences are a powerful feature in SQL that provide an easy way to generate unique numbers for various purposes, especially when generating primary key values for tables."
