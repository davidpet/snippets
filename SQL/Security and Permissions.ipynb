    "# Roles and Users\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In SQL, roles and users are used to manage security and permissions within a database. Roles are used to group users and assign permissions to them. Users are individual database accounts that can be granted roles and permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code snippet demonstrates the creation of a role and a user using the `CREATE ROLE` and `CREATE USER` statements. The `GRANT` statement is used to assign a role to a user and grant specific permissions to the role. The `REVOKE` statement is used to revoke a role or specific permissions from a role.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `HAS_ROLE` function is used to check if a user has a specific role, and the `HAS_PERM` function is used to check if a user has a specific permission on a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code also includes examples of listing all roles and users in the database, as well as listing the roles granted to a user or another role.\n",
    "\n",
    "When executed, the code will print the expected results of the queries, demonstrating the usage and functionality of roles and users in SQL."
