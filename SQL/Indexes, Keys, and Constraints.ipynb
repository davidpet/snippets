    "# Creating and Managing Indexes\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- Indexes are used to improve the performance of queries by allowing the database to quickly locate the rows that match certain criteria.\n",
    "- The `CREATE INDEX` statement is used to create an index on one or more columns of a table.\n",
    "- The `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` statement creates a unique index, which ensures that the indexed columns contain only unique values.\n",
    "- Indexes can be created on a single column or multiple columns.\n",
    "- Constraints are used to enforce rules and relationships on the data in a table.\n",
    "- The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to add constraints to an existing table.\n",
    "- The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint defines a column or a set of columns as the primary key for a table.\n",
    "- The `UNIQUE` constraint ensures that the values in the specified column(s) are unique.\n",
    "- The `FOREIGN KEY` constraint establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.\n",
    "- Indexes and constraints can be dropped using the `DROP INDEX` and `ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT` statements, respectively."

    "Next, we show how to retrieve data from the table using a simple `SELECT` statement. We also demonstrate updating and deleting records using the primary key.\n",

We then drop the primary key constraint and successfully insert the record with the previously duplicate primary key value.\n",

    "Finally, we create another table called `products` with an auto-increment primary key column using the `SERIAL` data type. We insert data into the table without specifying the primary key value, and retrieve the data using a `SELECT` statement. We also attempt to insert a record with a specific primary key value, which results in an error due to the auto-increment property of the primary key column.\n",
