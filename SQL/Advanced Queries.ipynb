    "# GROUP BY and HAVING\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In this code snippet, we demonstrate the usage of `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses in SQL for advanced queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group rows based on one or more columns. In the first example, we group the employees by department and calculate the total salary for each department using the `SUM` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `HAVING` clause is used to filter the grouped results based on a condition. In the second example, we retrieve the departments with a total salary greater than 6000.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third example, we calculate the average salary and the number of employees for each department using the `AVG` and `COUNT` functions. The `HAVING` clause is then used to filter the departments with more than 2 employees and an average salary greater than 5000.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples demonstrate how `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` can be used to perform advanced queries and apply conditions to grouped results."
