    "# SQL in Big Data Ecosystem (e.g., HiveQL)\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In this code snippet, we are demonstrating the usage of SQL in a Big Data ecosystem, specifically using HiveQL. HiveQL is a variation of SQL that is used in Apache Hive, a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code begins by creating a table called \"employees\" with columns for id, name, age, and salary. This table will be used to store employee data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we insert some sample data into the \"employees\" table using the `INSERT INTO` statement. Multiple rows can be inserted in a single statement by separating them with commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we query all the employees from the \"employees\" table using the `SELECT` statement. The `*` symbol is used to select all columns from the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "When executed, the code will create the table, insert the sample data, and then print the result of the SELECT query, which should display the employee data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 | John Doe | 30 | 5000.00\n",
    "2 | Jane Smith | 35 | 6000.00\n",
    "3 | Mike Johnson | 40 | 7000.00\n",
