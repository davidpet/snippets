    "# Stored Procedures and Functions\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "This code snippet demonstrates the usage of stored procedures and functions in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code starts by creating a sample table called \"employees\" with columns for id, name, age, and salary.\n",
    "2. A stored procedure named \"insert_employee\" is created using the `CREATE PROCEDURE` statement. This procedure takes four input parameters (employee_id, employee_name, employee_age, employee_salary) and inserts a new employee record into the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "3. The stored procedure is called using the `CALL` statement, passing the appropriate values for the input parameters.\n",
    "4. Next, a stored function named \"calculate_average_salary\" is created using the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement. This function calculates the average salary of all employees in the \"employees\" table and returns the result.\n",
    "5. The stored function is called using the `SET` statement to assign the result to a variable (@avg_salary). The variable is then selected to print the average salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usage of stored procedures and functions in SQL allows for encapsulating reusable logic and performing complex operations within the database itself. They can be called from SQL statements or other stored procedures/functions, providing modularity and code organization."

    "In this example, we create a table called \"employees\" to store employee information.

    "# Cursors\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In this code snippet, we demonstrate the usage of cursors in SQL. Cursors allow us to retrieve and manipulate rows from a result set one at a time. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We create a table called `employees` to store employee data.\n",
    "2. Some sample data is inserted into the `employees` table.\n",
    "3. We declare a cursor named `employee_cursor` using the `DECLARE CURSOR` statement. The cursor is defined to select all columns from the `employees` table.\n",
    "4. Variables `@id`, `@name`, `@age`, and `@salary` are declared to store the fetched values from the cursor.\n",
    "5. The cursor is opened using the `OPEN` statement.\n",
    "6. The first row is fetched from the cursor into the variables using the `FETCH NEXT` statement.\n",
    "7. We enter a loop using the `WHILE` statement, which continues as long as the fetch status is successful (`@@FETCH_STATUS = 0`).\n",
    "8. Inside the loop, we print the employee details using the `PRINT` statement.\n",
    "9. Another row is fetched from the cursor using the `FETCH NEXT` statement.\n",
    "10. The loop continues until all rows have been fetched.\n",
    "11. Finally, we close and deallocate the cursor using the `CLOSE` and `DEALLOCATE` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code snippet demonstrates the basic usage of cursors in SQL, allowing you to process rows from a result set one by one. Cursors can be useful in scenarios where you need to perform complex operations on individual rows or when you need to iterate over a result set in a specific order. However, it's important to note that cursors can have performance implications and should be used judiciously."

    "# Transactions and Locking\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In this code snippet, we demonstrate the usage of transactions and locking in SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions are used to group a set of database operations into a single logical unit. In this example, we start a transaction using the `BEGIN TRANSACTION` statement. Within the transaction, we perform two updates on the `accounts` table to transfer 100.00 from account 1 to account 2. We also insert a new transaction record into the `transactions` table. Finally, we commit the transaction using the `COMMIT` statement, which makes all the changes permanent.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using transactions, we ensure that either all the operations within the transaction are successfully completed, or none of them are. This helps maintain data integrity and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SELECT` statements at the end of the code snippet are used to print the updated account balances and the transaction records, demonstrating the successful execution of the transaction.\n",
