    "# Lambdas\n",
    "\n",
    "This code snippet demonstrates the usage of lambdas in Java. Lambdas are a concise way to represent anonymous functions, allowing you to pass behavior as a parameter to methods or define inline functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Example 1, a lambda expression is used to define a function that squares an integer. The lambda expression `(Integer x) -> x * x` takes an integer `x` and returns its square. The `apply` method is used to apply the function to the value `5`, resulting in the expected output of `25`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2 shows a lambda expression with multiple parameters. The lambda expression `(x, y) -> x + y` takes two integers `x` and `y` and returns their sum. The `apply` method is used to apply the function to the values `3` and `4`, resulting in the expected output of `7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3 demonstrates a lambda expression with no parameters. The lambda expression `() -> System.out.println(\"Hello, Lambda!\")` represents a function with no input parameters that prints \"Hello, Lambda!\". The `run` method is used to execute the lambda expression, resulting in the expected output of `Hello, Lambda!`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 4 showcases the usage of lambdas in a `forEach` loop. The lambda expression `(Integer number) -> System.out.println(number)` is used as the action to be performed for each element in the `numbers` list. The lambda expression prints each number on a new line, resulting in the expected output of `1 2 3 4 5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 5 demonstrates the usage of a lambda expression with a predicate. The lambda expression `(Integer number) -> number % 2 == 0` represents a predicate that checks if a number is even. The `test` method is used to apply the predicate to the value `6`, resulting in the expected output of `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 6 showcases the usage of a lambda expression with a consumer. The lambda expression `(String str) -> System.out.println(str.toUpperCase())` represents a consumer that takes a string and prints its uppercase version. The `accept` method is used to apply the consumer to the string `\"hello\"`, resulting in the expected output of `HELLO`."

    "# Closures (ref vs. value)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Closures in Java allow you to define functions that can access variables from their enclosing scope, even if those variables are not passed as arguments.\n",
    "- In Example 1, a closure is created using a lambda expression that accesses the local variable `x`. The closure is then invoked with an argument `5`, resulting in the sum of `x` and `y` being printed.\n",
    "- Example 2 demonstrates closures with instance variables. The `ClosureExample` class has an instance variable `x`, which is accessed within the closure defined in the `performClosure` method. The closure is invoked with an argument `0`, resulting in the sum of `x`, `y`, and `z` being printed.\n",
    "- Example 3 shows closures with effectively final variables. The variable `z` is treated as `final`, but it is not explicitly marked as such. The closure accesses `z` and adds it to the argument `y`.\n",
    "- Example 4 demonstrates closures modifying variables. The closure takes an index and doubles the value at that index in the `array`. The modified value is printed after invoking the closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closures are a powerful feature in functional programming that allow for flexible and concise code. They provide a way to encapsulate behavior and access variables from their surrounding scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Unlike other languages, Java does not allow you to modify a variable directly via a closure.  That is the `effectively final` rule - the lambda may not modify the variable and the code around the variable may also not modify it, or the lambda will be a compile error. If you need to simulate that behavior, use an effectively final object whose members can be changed from the lambda instead (or an array)."
