    "The Java `Console` class provides methods for reading input from the console and printing output to the console. It is commonly used for simple text-based user interactions in command-line applications.\n",

    "In the code snippet, we demonstrate various aspects of console I/O using the `Console` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reading a line of text from the user using `readLine()`.\n",
    "2. Reading a password from the user using `readPassword()`.\n",
    "3. Printing formatted output using `format()`.\n",
    "4. Reading a single character from the user.\n",
    "5. Reading an integer from the user.\n",
    "6. Reading a floating-point number from the user.\n",
    "7. Reading a boolean value from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `Console` class is only available if the application is run from a command-line environment that supports console I/O. If the application is run from an IDE or an environment without a console, the `console` object may be `null`."
