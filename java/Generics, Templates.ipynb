    "In this code snippet, we demonstrate the usage of generic functions in Java. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `sum` function is a generic function that takes two arguments of any type that extends the `Number` class and returns their sum. The type parameter `T` is bounded by `Number` to ensure that only numeric types can be used. The function uses the `doubleValue()` method to convert the arguments to `double` values and perform the addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `printList` function is another generic function that takes a list of any type and prints its elements. The type parameter `T` is not bounded, allowing any type to be used. The function uses a for-each loop to iterate over the elements of the list and prints each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `main` method, we demonstrate the usage of these generic functions with different types. We use the `sum` function to calculate the sum of integers and doubles, and we use the `printList` function to print the elements of a list of strings and a list of integers. The expected output is also provided for each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: in Java, to have a generic on a primitive type, you need to use the __boxed types__ instead of the primitives. That's just a result of the history of how the type system was cobbled together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: in Java, for functions, the type portion (eg. `<T>` goes __before the return value__ instead of after the function name like in basically every other language).  Also note that this is not the case with classes."

    "# Explicitly Calling Generic Function with a Type\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, generics allow us to create classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with different types. Sometimes, we may want to explicitly call a generic method with a specific type argument instead of relying on type inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code snippet, we have a class `Main` with a generic method `printValue`. This method takes a generic type argument `T` and prints the value passed to it. The `main` method demonstrates various ways to explicitly call the `printValue` method with different type arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by explicitly calling the method with the type argument `String` using the syntax `Main.<String>printValue(\"Hello\")`. This prints `Hello` to the console. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we omit the type argument and rely on type inference to determine the type. For example, `Main.printValue(10)` prints `10` to the console. Type inference works with complex types as well, as shown by `Main.printValue(new ArrayList<>())` which prints `[]` (an empty list).\n",
    "\n",
    "We continue to demonstrate explicit calls with different type arguments, including `Boolean`, `List<Integer>`, `List<String>`, `List<List<Integer>>`, and `List<List<List<Integer>>>`. In each case, the expected output is shown as a comment next to the print statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code snippet showcases that we can explicitly call a generic method with a specific type argument, allowing us to control the type used in the method invocation.\n",
    "\n",

    "If you do something like `new List()` or `List l = ` without specifying a type parameter, that is known as a __raw type__ or __unbound type__.  It is basically pre-erased so that the compiler doesn't know the type during compilation just like you usually can't at runtime.  The reason it still works is because of the fundamental rule of generics: you can only use __reference types__. Underneath, generics are dealing with `Object`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The compiler will generate an __unchecked warning__ if you don't suppress it (you shouldn't suppress it).\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of using a raw type is that the compiler basically lets anything through because it doesn't know the type at all. So code that __shouldn't compile__ will compile, leaving __bugs__ in the code. The only reason you're allowed to do this is for __backward compatibility__ with pre-Java 5 code when generics were first introduced.\n",
    "\n",

    "    - even if the type can't be inferred, it doesn't really matter (eg. if left is raw type)\n",
    "- once the instance is created, all that matters is the interface to it (the left side).\n",
    "    - the instance internally just deals with `Object` or whatever type is mentioned in `<T extends ...>` syntax\n",
    "    - if you properly type the left side, the compiler will stop any mistake\n",
    "- if the interface used on the left side and further operations is the raw type, more serious issues happen\n",
    "    - it can be assigned from a raw or bound instance and effectively erases the type\n",
    "    - then you can pass in any object to methods of the generic class\n",
    "        - but if the class uses `<T extends ...>` syntax the compiler gets another chance to check that it's at least that type\n",
    "    - a collection can end up storing instances of objects that mismatch the type it was created for due to the actions of one raw interface adding to it\n",
    "    - the raw interface is allowed to be assigned to any bound type of the interface\n",
    "    - when you try retrieve an item, if the retrieval results in a cast, it will throw a runtime exception, but if not, it will pass straight through and give unexpected results"
