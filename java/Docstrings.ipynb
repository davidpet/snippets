    "In Java, docstrings are commonly referred to as \"Javadoc comments\". They are used to provide documentation for classes, methods, and fields. Javadoc comments start with `/**` and end with `*/`. Within the comments, you can use special tags like `@param`, `@return`, and `@throws` to provide additional information about the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code snippet above, we have a class `DocstringsFunctionsDemo` that demonstrates the usage of Javadoc comments for functions. The class contains three functions: `sum`, `product`, and `factorial`. Each function has a Javadoc comment that describes its purpose, parameters, and return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `main` method, we declare two integers `a` and `b` and demonstrate the usage of the `sum` and `product` functions by calling them with `a` and `b` as arguments. We also declare an integer `n` and demonstrate the usage of the `factorial` function by calling it with `n` as an argument.\n",
