    "# Access Modifiers\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In Java, access modifiers are used to control the visibility and accessibility of classes, variables, and methods. There are four access modifiers in Java:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `public`: The public access modifier allows the class, variable, or method to be accessed from anywhere.\n",
    "2. `private`: The private access modifier restricts the access to within the same class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.\n",
    "3. `protected`: The protected access modifier allows the class, variable, or method to be accessed within the same package or by a subclass in a different package.\n",
    "4. Default (package-private): If no access modifier is specified, it is considered as default (package-private). It allows the class, variable, or method to be accessed within the same package.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code snippet above, we have a class `AccessModifiersDemo` that demonstrates the usage of access modifiers. It has variables and methods with different access modifiers. The `AnotherClass` is another class in the same package that demonstrates the access to these variables and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `AnotherClass`, we create an instance of `AccessModifiersDemo` and access the variables and methods using different access modifiers. We can see that public variables and methods can be accessed from anywhere, while private and protected variables and methods are not accessible outside the class. Default variables and methods can be accessed within the same package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected output of the code snippet is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "10\n",
    "This is a public method.\n",
    "40\n",
    "This is a default method.\n",

    "# Constructors, Initialization Lists\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In this code snippet, we demonstrate the use of constructors and initialization blocks in Java classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Constructors:\n",
    "   - The `Person` class has three constructors: a default constructor, a parameterized constructor, and a copy constructor.\n",
    "   - The default constructor initializes the `name` and `age` fields to default values.\n",
    "   - The parameterized constructor takes `name` and `age` as arguments and initializes the fields accordingly.\n",
    "   - The copy constructor creates a new `Person` object by copying the values from another `Person` object.\n",
    "   - These constructors allow us to create `Person` objects with different initialization options.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initialization blocks:\n",
    "   - The `Person` class also contains three types of initialization blocks: an instance initialization block, a static initialization block, and an initialization block.\n",
    "   - The instance initialization block is executed before the constructor whenever a new object is created. In this case, it prints \"Instance initialization block\".\n",
    "   - The static initialization block is executed only once when the class is loaded into memory. In this case, it prints \"Static initialization block\".\n",
    "   - The initialization block is executed before the constructor but after the instance initialization block. In this case, it prints \"Initialization block\".\n",
    "   - Initialization blocks are useful for performing common initialization tasks or executing code that needs to be run before object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Usage:\n",
    "   - The `main` method demonstrates the creation of `Person` objects using different constructors.\n",
    "   - `person1` is created using the default constructor, `person2` is created using the parameterized constructor, and `person3` is created using the copy constructor.\n",
    "   - The `getName` and `getAge` methods are used to retrieve the values of the `name` and `age` fields for each `Person` object.\n",
    "   - The expected output is printed to show the values of the objects' fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this code snippet provides a comprehensive demonstration of constructors and initialization blocks in Java classes."

    "# Base and Delegating Constructors\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In this code snippet, we demonstrate the concept of base and delegating constructors in Java. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Vehicle` class is the base class that represents a generic vehicle. It has a constructor that takes the brand and color as parameters and initializes the corresponding instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Car` class is a derived class that extends the `Vehicle` class. It adds an additional instance variable `numOfDoors` to represent the number of doors in the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Car` class has two constructors:\n",
    "  - The first constructor is a delegating constructor that takes the brand, color, and number of doors as parameters. It calls the base constructor using the `super` keyword to initialize the brand and color.\n",
    "  - The second constructor is an overloaded constructor that takes only the brand and color as parameters. It calls the first constructor with a default value of 4 for the number of doors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the `main` method, we create two instances of the `Car` class using different constructors. We then print the details of each car, including the brand, color, and number of doors.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the code is executed, the following output is produced:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Car 1 Details:\n",
    "Brand: Toyota\n",
    "Color: Red\n",
    "Number of Doors: 2\n",

    "Brand: Honda\n",
    "Color: Blue\n",
    "Number of Doors: 4\n",
    "```\n",

    "# Calling Base Class\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In Java, when a class extends another class, it inherits all the methods and fields of the base class. The derived class can override the methods of the base class to provide its own implementation. However, there may be situations where you want to call a method of the base class from the derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given code snippet, we have a base class `Animal` and a derived class `Dog` that extends the `Animal` class. The `Animal` class has a `sound()` method that prints \"Animal is making a sound\". The `Dog` class overrides the `sound()` method to print \"Dog is barking\" and also has its own `display()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "To call the base class method from the derived class, you can use the syntax `((BaseClassName) derivedClassObject).methodName()`. In the code snippet, we demonstrate this by calling the `sound()` method of the base class using the derived class object `dog`. We cast `dog` to `Animal` using `(Animal) dog` and then call the `sound()` method.\n",

    "# Name Hiding\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In Java, name hiding occurs when a subclass declares a field or method with the same name as a field or method in its superclass. This can lead to confusion when accessing the field or method from different contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code snippet above, we have a `Parent` class and a `Child` class that extends the `Parent` class. Both classes have a field named `x`, but with different values. The `Parent` class has `x` set to 10, while the `Child` class has `x` set to 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Child` class also overrides the `printX()` method from the `Parent` class. When we create an instance of `Child` and call `printX()`, it prints the value of `x` from the `Child` class, which is 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the `x` field from the `Parent` class within the `Child` class, we can use the `super` keyword. The `printParentX()` method demonstrates this by printing the value of `x` from the `Parent` class, which is 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `main` method, we create an instance of `Child` and call `printX()` and `printParentX()`, which both print the expected values.\n",

    "We also assign the `Child` instance to a `Parent` reference variable. When we call `printX()` on the `Parent` reference, it still prints the value of `x` from the `Child` class. However, when we directly access the `x` field using the `parent.x` syntax, it prints the value of `x` from the `Parent` class, which is 10. This demonstrates that name hiding only affects the overridden methods, not the fields."

    "1. We start by declaring a variable `dynamicVariable` of type Object and assign a string to it. We then print the value of `dynamicVariable`, which is \"Hello, World!\". Next, we assign an integer to the same variable and print its value, which is now 42.\n",
    "\n",

We print the value of the `str` variable, which is \"Hello, World!\". Similarly, we assign a double to `obj` and cast it to a double. We print the value of the `num` variable, which is 3.14.\n",

    "1. Static variable: `staticVariable` is declared at the class level and is shared among all instances of the class.\n",
    "2. Instance variable: `instanceVariable` is declared at the class level but belongs to each instance of the class individually.\n",
    "3. Static block: The static block is executed when the class is loaded and is used to initialize static variables or perform other static initialization tasks.\n",
    "4. Instance block: The instance block is executed before the constructor of the class and is used to initialize instance variables or perform other instance-specific initialization tasks.\n",
    "5. Constructor: The constructor is a special method used to initialize objects of a class.\n",
    "6. Static method: `staticMethod()` is a method declared with the `static` keyword and can be called without creating an instance of the class.\n",
    "7. Instance method: `instanceMethod()` is a method that belongs to each instance of the class and can only be called on an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In the code snippet above, we demonstrate a simplified example of partial classes in Java. We split the `Person` class into two parts: the declaration and the implementation. The declaration part contains the class definition and any partial method declarations, while the implementation part contains the remaining implementation details.\n",

In this case, the `printDetails()` method is called from the `main()` method, and it prints the name and age of the person.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the behavior of partial classes, you can split the class into multiple files or use inner classes. In this example, we used a single file for simplicity.\n",

    "# Destructors/Finalizers/Disposable Pattern\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- Destructors (also known as finalizers) are special methods that are automatically called by the garbage collector before an object is destroyed. They are used to perform cleanup actions, such as releasing resources, before the object is garbage collected.\n",
    "- In Java, destructors are implemented using the `finalize()` method. The `finalize()` method is defined in the `Object` class and can be overridden in a subclass to provide custom cleanup logic.\n",
    "- In the example, the `MyClass` class demonstrates the usage of a destructor. The `finalize()` method is overridden to perform some cleanup actions and then calls the base class `finalize()` method.\n",
    "- To make an object eligible for garbage collection, the reference to the object needs to be set to `null`. The garbage collector will then automatically call the `finalize()` method before destroying the object.\n",
    "- The `System.gc()` method can be used to explicitly request garbage collection, although it is generally not recommended to rely on this method for normal cleanup operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Disposable pattern is an alternative approach to resource cleanup, where objects that hold resources implement the `AutoCloseable` interface and provide a `close()` method to release the resources.\n",
    "- In the example, the `MyDisposableClass` implements the `AutoCloseable` interface and provides a `close()` method to release the resource it holds.\n",
    "- The `try-with-resources` statement is used to automatically call the `close()` method at the end of the block, ensuring proper resource cleanup.\n",

    "# Callable Object/Call Operator\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In Java, a `Callable` object represents a task that can be executed asynchronously and returns a result. It is similar to the `Runnable` interface, but the `Callable` interface allows the task to return a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the `Callable` object and the call operator, we first define a class `MyCallable` that implements the `Callable` interface. The `MyCallable` class takes an integer number as a parameter and calculates its square in the `call()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `main()` method, we create an instance of `MyCallable` and demonstrate two ways to execute the task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We call the `call()` method directly on the `MyCallable` instance and store the result in `result1`. This is a synchronous execution, meaning the program will wait for the task to complete before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We create a new `Thread` and pass the `MyCallable` instance to its constructor. We start the thread, which executes the `call()` method asynchronously. We then wait for the thread to finish using the `join()` method and retrieve the result in `result2`. This demonstrates the asynchronous execution of the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we print the results to the console to verify the expected output."
