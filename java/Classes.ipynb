    "# Constructors, Initialization Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code snippet, we demonstrate the use of constructors and initialization blocks in Java classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Constructors:\n",
    "   - The `Person` class has three constructors: a default constructor, a parameterized constructor, and a copy constructor.\n",
    "   - The default constructor initializes the `name` and `age` fields to default values.\n",
    "   - The parameterized constructor takes `name` and `age` as arguments and initializes the fields accordingly.\n",
    "   - The copy constructor creates a new `Person` object by copying the values from another `Person` object.\n",
    "   - These constructors allow us to create `Person` objects with different initialization options.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initialization blocks:\n",
    "   - The `Person` class also contains three types of initialization blocks: an instance initialization block, a static initialization block, and an initialization block.\n",
    "   - The instance initialization block is executed before the constructor whenever a new object is created. In this case, it prints \"Instance initialization block\".\n",
    "   - The static initialization block is executed only once when the class is loaded into memory. In this case, it prints \"Static initialization block\".\n",
    "   - The initialization block is executed before the constructor but after the instance initialization block. In this case, it prints \"Initialization block\".\n",
    "   - Initialization blocks are useful for performing common initialization tasks or executing code that needs to be run before object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Usage:\n",
    "   - The `main` method demonstrates the creation of `Person` objects using different constructors.\n",
    "   - `person1` is created using the default constructor, `person2` is created using the parameterized constructor, and `person3` is created using the copy constructor.\n",
    "   - The `getName` and `getAge` methods are used to retrieve the values of the `name` and `age` fields for each `Person` object.\n",
    "   - The expected output is printed to show the values of the objects' fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this code snippet provides a comprehensive demonstration of constructors and initialization blocks in Java classes."
