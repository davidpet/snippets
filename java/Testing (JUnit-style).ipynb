    "Explanation:\n",
    "In this code snippet, we demonstrate the usage of test classes, test methods, and test suites in JUnit-style testing for Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We define two test classes, `TestClass1` and `TestClass2`, each containing test methods annotated with `@Test`. These test methods perform assertions to validate expected behavior.\n",
    "- We create a test suite class `TestSuite` using the `@RunWith` and `@SuiteClasses` annotations. The `@RunWith` annotation specifies the test runner to use, and `@SuiteClasses` specifies the test classes to include in the suite.\n",
    "- The `TestSuite` class itself doesn't have any test methods. It is used to group the test classes together.\n",
    "- We can also define setup and teardown methods in the test suite class. These methods will be executed before and after running the test classes. In this example, we simply print messages to demonstrate the setup and teardown.\n",
    "- Finally, in the `Main` class, we run the test suite using `JUnitCore.runClasses(TestSuite.class)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the code, you should see the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Setting up the test suite...\n",
    ".\n",
    "Time: 0.006\n",

    "OK (2 tests)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tearing down the test suite...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output shows that the test suite is set up, the tests in `TestClass1` and `TestClass2` are executed, and the test suite is torn down. The `.` represents a successful test execution, and the summary at the end shows the number of tests executed.\n",

    "The test cases `test1()`, `test2()`, and `test3()` demonstrate the persistence of the `classData` variable between tests. In `test1()`, we access the initial value of `classData` (10) and assert that it is equal to the expected value. In `test2()`, we modify the value of `classData` to 20 and assert the updated value. Finally, in `test3()`, we access the modified value of `classData` and assert it again.\n",

    "When running the test class, the output will be:\n",
