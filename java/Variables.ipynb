    "# Interning\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In Java, interning is a process where the JVM stores only one copy of each distinct immutable value, such as strings, integers, and characters. This is done to optimize memory usage and improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code snippet, we demonstrate interning for strings, integers, and characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Example 1, we declare three string variables: `str1`, `str2`, and `str3`. The strings \"Hello\" are interned, so `str1` and `str2` refer to the same object. However, `str3` is created using the `new` keyword, resulting in a different object. The print statements compare the references of the variables, showing that `str1 == str2` is `true`, while `str1 == str3` is `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Example 2, we declare three integer variables: `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`. Integers from -128 to 127 are interned, so `num1` and `num2` refer to the same object. `num3` is created using the `new` keyword, resulting in a different object. The print statements compare the references of the variables, showing that `num1 == num2` is `true`, while `num1 == num3` is `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Example 3, we declare three character variables: `ch1`, `ch2`, and `ch3`. Characters from \\u0000 to \\u007F are interned, so `ch1` and `ch2` refer to the same object. `ch3` is created using the `new` keyword, resulting in a different object. The print statements compare the references of the variables, showing that `ch1 == ch2` is `true`, while `ch1 == ch3` is `false`."

    "# Statics\n",

    "4. A static block is defined using the `static` keyword. This block is executed when the class is loaded and is used to initialize static variables or perform other static operations. In this case, it prints a message.\n",
    "5. The `main` method is defined, which serves as the entry point of the program.\n",
    "6. Inside the `main` method, the static variable `staticVariable` is accessed and printed.\n",

    "9. The static method `staticMethod()` is called.\n",

    "When the code is executed, it will print the expected output as mentioned in the comments. The static variable can be accessed and modified without creating an instance of the class. Static methods can be called directly using the class name. Static blocks are executed only once when the class is loaded."

    "# Type Inference\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In Java, type inference allows the compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its initializer expression. This reduces the need for explicit type declarations, making the code more concise and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code snippet above, we demonstrate type inference in various scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. In variable declaration, the `var` keyword is used to declare variables without explicitly specifying their types. The compiler infers the types based on the initializer expressions. We demonstrate this by declaring variables `name`, `age`, `salary`, and `isEmployed` with different types (`String`, `int`, `double`, and `boolean` respectively) and printing their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Type inference is also applicable to method return types. In the `add` method, we use `var` as the return type, and the compiler infers it as `int`. The method takes two parameters of inferred types and returns their sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Type inference can be used in enhanced for loops. We declare an array of integers and iterate over it using the enhanced for loop. The loop variable `number` is inferred as `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Type inference is also applicable to lambda expressions. We declare a lambda expression `multiply` that takes two `int` parameters and returns their product. The `var` keyword is used to infer the type of the lambda expression as `IntBinaryOperator`. We then apply the lambda expression to calculate the product and print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type inference simplifies the code by reducing the verbosity of type declarations while maintaining type safety. It is particularly useful in scenarios where the type can be easily inferred from the context."

    "In Java, there are multiple ways to check for equality between variables. This code snippet demonstrates four different approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Equality using the `==` operator: This operator checks if two variables refer to the same memory location. It is used for primitive types and object references. In the example, `a == b` returns `false` because `a` and `b` have different values, while `a == c` returns `true` because `a` and `c` have the same value. For strings, `str1 == str2` returns `true` because both variables refer to the same string literal, while `str1 == str3` returns `false` because `str3` is a new string object created using the `new` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Equality using the `equals()` method: This method is used to compare the content of objects. For strings, it checks if the characters are the same. In the example, `str1.equals(str2)` and `str1.equals(str3)` both return `true` because the content of the strings is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Equality using the `compareTo()` method: This method is used to compare strings lexicographically. It returns 0 if the strings are equal. In the example, `str1.compareTo(str2) == 0` and `str1.compareTo(str3) == 0` both return `true` because the strings are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Equality using the `Objects.equals()` method: This method is available since Java 7 and provides a null-safe way to check for equality. It returns `true` if both objects are `null` or if the `equals()` method of the first object returns `true` when passed the second object. In the example, `Objects.equals(str1, str2)` and `Objects.equals(str1, str3)` both return `true` because the strings are equal.\n",

    "In Java, casting refers to the process of converting a value from one data type to another. Casting can be either implicit or explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implicit Casting (Widening Conversion): It occurs when the target type has a larger range than the source type. In the code snippet, an integer value `num1` is implicitly cast to a double value `num2` by assigning `num1` to `num2`. The output demonstrates that the integer value is successfully cast to a double.\n",

    "- Explicit Casting (Narrowing Conversion): It occurs when the target type has a smaller range than the source type. In the code snippet, a double value `num3` is explicitly cast to an integer value `num4` using `(int)` before `num3`. The output shows that the double value is truncated to an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coercion: It refers to the automatic conversion of one data type to another during expressions or assignments. In the code snippet, the division of two integers `num5` and `num6` results in an integer value due to coercion. The output demonstrates that the result is an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coercion with Mixed Types: When performing operations between different data types, Java automatically promotes the lower-ranked type to the higher-ranked type. In the code snippet, the division of an integer `num7` and a double `num8` results in a double value due to coercion. The output shows the result as a double.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coercion with Mixed Types and Explicit Casting: It is possible to combine coercion and explicit casting. In the code snippet, the division of an integer `num9` and a double `num10` is coerced to a double, and then explicitly cast to an integer using `(int)`. The output demonstrates that the result is an integer.\n",

    "# Type Union\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In Java, the concept of type union allows a variable to have multiple possible types. This is useful when a variable can hold different types of values at different points in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code snippet above, we declare a variable `value` with a type union of `String` and `Integer`. This means that `value` can hold either a `String` or an `Integer` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate the usage of type union by assigning both a string and an integer value to the `value` variable. We then print the value to verify the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code also shows the usage of type union in method parameters. The `printValue` method accepts a parameter of type union (`String | Integer`) and prints the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle the different possible types in a type union, we use the `instanceof` operator to check the type of the variable. Based on the type, we perform specific operations or print different messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the code demonstrates the usage of type union in a switch statement. The switch statement checks the value of `value` and executes the corresponding case based on its type.\n",

    "# Variable Lifetime inc. Caveats\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In Java, variables have a specific lifetime, which is the duration for which they exist and hold their values. The lifetime of a variable depends on its scope, which is determined by where the variable is declared.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code snippet above, we demonstrate the lifetime of variables in different scopes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Local Variables:\n",
    "   - `x` is a local variable declared in the `main` method. It has a block scope and exists until the end of the block.\n",
    "   - `y` is a local variable declared in a nested block. It exists only within that block and cannot be accessed outside of it.\n",
    "   - `z` is a local variable declared in a conditional block. It exists only within that block and cannot be accessed outside of it.\n",
    "   - `j` is a local variable declared in a loop block. It exists only within each iteration of the loop and cannot be accessed outside of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Instance Variables:\n",
    "   - `instanceVar` is an instance variable declared in the `VariableLifetimeDemo` class. It exists as long as the instance of the class exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code snippet demonstrates the scoping rules and shows how variables can be accessed within their respective scopes. Attempting to access a variable outside of its scope will result in a compilation error.\n",

    "# Move and Copy Semantics\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In Java, variables can be assigned using copy semantics or move semantics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Copy semantics involve assigning the value of one variable to another. Modifying the original variable does not affect the copied variable. In the code snippet, `x` is assigned the value `10`, and then `y` is assigned the value of `x`. Modifying `x` later does not change the value of `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Move semantics involve swapping the values of two variables. In the code snippet, the values of `x` and `y` are swapped using a temporary variable `temp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of move semantics also applies to objects. In the code snippet, `StringBuilder` objects are used to demonstrate move semantics. Initially, `sb1` and `sb2` reference the same `StringBuilder` object. Modifying `sb1` also affects `sb2` since they refer to the same object. However, assigning a new `StringBuilder` object to `sb1` creates a new object and `sb2` still references the original object."
