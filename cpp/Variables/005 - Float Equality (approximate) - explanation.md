# Float Equality (approximate)
In this code snippet, we first declare and initialize two float variables `a` and `b`. We then print their values, which should both be `0.3`. However, due to the way floating point numbers are represented in memory, the sum `0.1 + 0.2` may not be exactly equal to `0.3`.

We then perform a direct comparison of `a` and `b` using the `==` operator. This comparison is likely to fail, even though `a` and `b` should theoretically be equal, because of the aforementioned precision issues with floating point numbers.

To correctly compare two floating point numbers for equality, we should instead check if the absolute difference between the two numbers is less than a small number (often called "epsilon"). In this code, we use `0.0001` as our epsilon. We use the `fabs` function from the `<cmath>` library to calculate the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, and then check if this difference is less than epsilon. If it is, we consider `a` and `b` to be approximately equal.
