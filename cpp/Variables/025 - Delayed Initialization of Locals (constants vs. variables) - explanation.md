# Delayed Initialization of Locals (constants vs. variables)
Please note that the above code will not compile. This is because in C++, you cannot delay the initialization of a constant. Once a constant is declared, it must be initialized at the same time. If you try to compile the above code, you will get a compile error on the lines where `b` and `d` are declared. This is because `b` and `d` are declared as constants but are not initialized immediately. In C++, constants must be initialized at the time of declaration. Here is the correct way to declare and initialize constants:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Delayed initialization of a local variable
    int a;
    a = 10;
    std::cout << "Value of a: " << a << std::endl; // Expected output: Value of a: 10

    // Immediate initialization of a local constant
    const int b = 20;
    std::cout << "Value of b: " << b << std::endl; // Expected output: Value of b: 20

    // Delayed initialization of a local variable with a function
    int c;
    c = a + b;
    std::cout << "Value of c: " << c << std::endl; // Expected output: Value of c: 30

    // Immediate initialization of a local constant with a function
    const int d = a + b;
    std::cout << "Value of d: " << d << std::endl; // Expected output: Value of d: 30

    return 0;
}
```

##### In the corrected code, `b` and `d` are initialized at the time of declaration, which is the correct way to declare and initialize constants in C++.
