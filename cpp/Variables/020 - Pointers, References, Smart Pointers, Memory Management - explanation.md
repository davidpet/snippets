# Pointers, References, Smart Pointers, Memory Management
In this code snippet, we first declare and initialize a variable `var`. Then, we declare a pointer `ptr` and initialize it with the address of `var`. We then change the value of `var` through `ptr`. 

Next, we declare a reference `ref` and initialize it with `var`. We then change the value of `var` through `ref`. 

After that, we dynamically allocate memory for an integer, assign it to `dyn`, and assign a value to it. We then deallocate the memory. 

Finally, we declare and initialize a smart pointer `smart` and assign a value to it. The memory allocated for `smart` will be automatically deallocated when `smart` goes out of scope. 

This code snippet demonstrates the use of variables, pointers, references, dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, and smart pointers in C++.
