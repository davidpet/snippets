# Data Types
The above code demonstrates the basic data types in C++. These include integer, floating point, double precision floating point, character, boolean, and wide character data types. The `int` keyword is used to declare an integer, `float` for floating point, `double` for double precision floating point, `char` for character, `bool` for boolean, and `wchar_t` for wide character. Each variable is initialized with a value and then printed to the console. The expected output is commented at the end of each print statement.
