# Constants/Final Variables
In the above code, we have demonstrated the use of constants in C++. Constants are declared using the `const` keyword and their value cannot be changed once assigned. We have shown how to declare constants of different data types including integer, float, character, string, and boolean. 

We also tried to change the value of a constant, which is not allowed in C++. This will result in a compile error. 

Note that the `const` keyword can also be used with pointers and references, but that is beyond the scope of this subtopic.
