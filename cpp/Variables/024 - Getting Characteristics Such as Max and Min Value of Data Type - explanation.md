# Getting Characteristics Such as Max and Min Value of Data Type
In the above code, we are using the `std::numeric_limits` template from the `<limits>` library to get the maximum and minimum values of different data types. This template provides a standardized way to query various properties of arithmetic types (e.g., `int`, `float`, `char`, etc.). 

We are using the `max()` and `min()` functions of the `std::numeric_limits` template to get the maximum and minimum values of the data types respectively. 

For the `char` data type, we are type casting the values to `int` before printing because the `char` data type is typically used to store characters, not numbers. If we print the `char` values directly, it may print characters instead of numbers. 

Please note that the exact maximum and minimum values can depend on the system and compiler.
