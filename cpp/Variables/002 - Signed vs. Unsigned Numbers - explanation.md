# Signed vs. Unsigned Numbers
In this code snippet, we demonstrate the difference between signed and unsigned integers in C++. 

A signed integer can hold both positive and negative numbers, while an unsigned integer can only hold positive numbers and zero. If you try to assign a negative number to an unsigned integer, it will wrap around to a very large positive number. Similarly, if you try to assign a number larger than the maximum positive number an integer can hold, it will wrap around to a negative number.

This behavior is due to the way integers are represented in binary. The most significant bit is used to represent the sign in a signed integer. If this bit is set, the number is negative. In an unsigned integer, all bits are used to represent the number, so there is no way to represent a negative number.

It's important to be aware of these differences when working with integers in C++, as they can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled correctly.
