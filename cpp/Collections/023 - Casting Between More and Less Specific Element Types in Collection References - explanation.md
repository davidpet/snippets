# Casting Between More and Less Specific Element Types in Collection References
In this code snippet, we have a base class `Animal` and a derived class `Dog`. We create a vector of `Animal` pointers and add a `Dog` to the collection. We then attempt to cast the `Animal` pointer to a `Dog` pointer using `dynamic_cast`. If the cast is successful, we call the overridden `makeSound` function in the `Dog` class. If the cast is not successful, we call the `makeSound` function in the `Animal` class.

The `dynamic_cast` operator is used for converting polymorphic types. It returns a null pointer if the object referred to does not contain the type casted to. In this case, if the `Animal` pointer does not actually point to a `Dog` object, the cast will fail and `dog` will be a null pointer.

This code snippet demonstrates how to cast between more and less specific element types in collection references in C++. It's important to note that this kind of casting should be used carefully, as it can lead to runtime errors if not used correctly. Always check the result of a `dynamic_cast` before using it.
