# Bitfields
Bitfields in C++ are used to reduce the memory consumption when you know the exact width of the data. They are defined inside a structure where the number of bits are also mentioned. The syntax is `unsigned int variable_name : number_of_bits;`. 

In the above code, we have a structure `BitField` with three bitfields `is_enabled`, `type`, and `id` with 1, 4, and 27 bits respectively. 

In the `main` function, we create an object `bf` of `BitField` and assign values to the bitfields. We then print the values. 

It's important to note that assigning a value that exceeds the bitfield's capacity results in undefined behavior. In the example, we try to assign 16 to `type`, which only has 4 bits. This results in undefined behavior and the output is unpredictable. 

Bitfields are a powerful tool for memory optimization, but they should be used with caution due to the potential for undefined behavior.
