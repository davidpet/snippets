# Sorted Versions of Collection Types

The sorted collections in C++ are mainly `std::set`, `std::multiset`, `std::map`, and `std::multimap`.

In the code, we have demonstrated the use of sorted collections in C++. The `std::set` and `std::multiset` are sorted collections of elements, where `std::set` does not allow duplicate elements while `std::multiset` does. The `std::map` and `std::multimap` are sorted collections of key-value pairs, where `std::map` does not allow duplicate keys while `std::multimap` does. The elements in these collections are automatically sorted upon insertion.
