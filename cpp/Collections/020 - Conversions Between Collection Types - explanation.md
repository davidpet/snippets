# Conversions Between Collection Types

1. The first part of the code demonstrates how to convert a vector to a set. This is done by passing the begin and end iterators of the vector to the set's constructor. The elements in the set are printed out and they should be the same as the elements in the vector.

2. The second part of the code shows how to convert a set to a list. This is done in a similar way to the vector to set conversion. The begin and end iterators of the set are passed to the list's constructor. The elements in the list are printed out and they should be the same as the elements in the set.

3. The third part of the code demonstrates how to convert a list to a vector. This is done by passing the begin and end iterators of the list to the vector's constructor. The elements in the vector are printed out and they should be the same as the elements in the list.

4. The fourth part of the code shows how to convert a map to a vector of pairs. This is done by passing the begin and end iterators of the map to the vector's constructor. The elements in the vector are printed out and they should be the same as the elements in the map.

5. The fifth part of the code demonstrates creating a vector from an array.

6. The sixth part of the code demonstarting creating an array from a vector.
