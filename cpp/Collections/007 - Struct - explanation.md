# Struct
In the above code, we have demonstrated the usage of structs in C++. 

1. A struct named 'Person' is defined with three member variables: name, age, and height. An instance of 'Person' is created and the member variables are accessed using the dot operator.

2. A struct named 'Book' is defined with a constructor. The constructor is a special function with the same name as the struct, which is used to initialize the member variables when an instance of the struct is created.

3. A struct named 'Rectangle' is defined with a method named 'area'. This method calculates and returns the area of the rectangle. An instance of 'Rectangle' is created and the 'area' method is called using the dot operator.

Structs in C++ are very flexible and can contain member variables, constructors, and methods. They are a fundamental part of the language and are used to group related data and functions together.
