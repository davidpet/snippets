# Index Operator

The index operator `[]` is used to access or modify elements in a collection. In C++, it can be used with arrays, vectors, and maps.

1. With arrays, the index operator is used to access or modify elements at a specific index. The index is zero-based, meaning the first element is at index 0.

2. With vectors, the index operator works similarly to arrays. It can be used to access or modify elements at a specific index.

3. With maps, the index operator is used to access or modify the value associated with a specific key. If the key does not exist, it is added to the map with a default value.

4. The index operator can also be used to modify elements in a collection. This is done by using the index operator on the left side of an assignment statement.
