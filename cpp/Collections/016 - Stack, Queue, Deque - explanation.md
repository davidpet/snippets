# Stack, Queue, Deque

In this code snippet, we first include the necessary headers for stack, queue, and deque. Then, in the main function, we demonstrate the usage of these three collections.

For the stack, we push three elements onto it, print the top element, pop the top element, and print the new top element.

For the queue, we push three elements onto it, print the front element, pop the front element, and print the new front element.

For the deque, we push two elements onto it (one at the back and one at the front), print the front and back elements, pop the front element, and pop the back element.

This code snippet covers the basic operations of these collections, including pushing elements, popping elements, and accessing elements. Other operations, such as checking if the collection is empty (using `empty()`) and getting the size of the collection (using `size()`), are also available for these collections.
