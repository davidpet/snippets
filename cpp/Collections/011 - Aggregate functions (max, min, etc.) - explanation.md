# Aggregate functions (max, min, etc.)

In the code, we have demonstrated the use of aggregate functions in C++ using the Standard Template Library (STL). The STL provides a variety of aggregate functions that can be used with collections such as vectors, lists, sets, etc.

We have used the `max_element` and `min_element` functions to find the maximum and minimum elements in a vector. These functions return an iterator pointing to the maximum and minimum elements respectively.

The `accumulate` function is used to find the sum of all elements in a vector. It takes a range (begin and end iterators) and an initial value for the sum.

The `count` function is used to count the occurrences of a specific element in a vector. It takes a range and the element to count.

These are just a few examples of the aggregate functions provided by the STL. There are many more such functions available, such as `find` (to find an element), `sort` (to sort the elements), `reverse` (to reverse the elements), etc.
