In C++, "slicing" is a concept that is often associated with object-oriented programming, specifically when dealing with inheritance and polymorphism. It refers to the situation where an object of a derived class is assigned to an instance of a base class, causing the loss of the derived class's specific attributes or methods. 

However, in the context of collections (like arrays, vectors, etc.), "slicing" can refer to the operation of extracting a subset of elements from the collection. C++ does not directly support slicing like Python or other high-level languages, but we can achieve similar functionality using iterators or the `std::copy` function from the Standard Template Library (STL).

Here is a code snippet demonstrating slicing in C++ using vectors:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // for std::copy

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize a vector
    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

    // Define the start and end iterators for the slice
    std::vector<int>::iterator start = vec.begin() + 2; // 3rd element
    std::vector<int>::iterator end = vec.begin() + 5; // 6th element

    // Create a new vector to hold the slice
    std::vector<int> slice(end - start);

    // Copy the elements from the original vector to the slice
    std::copy(start, end, slice.begin());

    // Print the elements of the slice
    for (int i : slice) {
        std::cout << i << " "; // Expected output: 3 4 5
    }

    return 0;
}
