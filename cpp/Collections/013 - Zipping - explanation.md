# Zipping
In the above code, we're simulating the "zipping" of two collections by iterating over them simultaneously. We're using the index to access corresponding elements from the two vectors. This approach works well when you know that the collections are of the same size.

If the vectors are of different sizes, this approach will not work correctly. You would need to add additional logic to handle this case, such as truncating the longer vector or filling in default values for the shorter one.

Also, note that this approach does not create a new collection that contains the zipped values. It simply prints out the pairs. If you wanted to create a new collection, you would need to create a vector of pairs (or a similar structure) and add each pair to this new vector.

This approach is quite flexible and can be adapted to "zip" together any number of collections, and collections of different types. However, it does require that you manually manage the iteration over the collections, which can be error-prone.
