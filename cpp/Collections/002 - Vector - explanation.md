# Vector

In this code snippet, we are demonstrating the usage of the `std::vector` in C++. 

1. We first declare an empty vector `vec1` of type `int`.
2. Then, we initialize another vector `vec2` with some integer values.
3. We access the elements of `vec2` using both the array-like syntax (`[]`) and the `at()` function.
4. We modify the first two elements of `vec2` using the same methods.
5. We add an element to `vec1` using the `push_back()` function.
6. We remove the last element from `vec2` using the `pop_back()` function.
7. We check if `vec1` is empty using the `empty()` function.
8. We get the size of `vec2` using the `size()` function.
9. Finally, we clear all elements from `vec1` using the `clear()` function.

Each of these operations is printed to the console to demonstrate the effect of the operation. The expected output is commented at the end of each print statement.
