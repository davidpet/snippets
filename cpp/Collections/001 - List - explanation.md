# List
In this code snippet, we have demonstrated the usage of the `std::list` collection in C++. We have shown how to declare a list, add elements to the front and back of the list, remove elements from the front and back of the list, insert elements at a specific position, and remove elements at a specific position. The `std::list` collection is a doubly-linked list that allows for efficient insertions and deletions at both ends and in the middle. However, it does not provide fast random access to its elements.
