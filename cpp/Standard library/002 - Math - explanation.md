# Math
The C++ standard library provides a set of built-in functions for mathematical operations. These functions are part of the `<cmath>` library and can be used for operations such as square root, power, absolute value, ceiling and floor values, logarithms, and trigonometric functions. The trigonometric functions use radians, not degrees, so the results might not be what you expect if you're thinking in degrees.
