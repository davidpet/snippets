## `std::variant` in C++

`std::variant` is a type-safe union introduced in C++17. It can hold a value of one of the specified types, but, unlike traditional unions, it maintains type-safety. At any given time, a `std::variant` holds a value of one of its alternative types (or it may be valueless, i.e., in a state not representing any value).

### Key Points:
- It provides a way to safely handle a set of types in a single variable.
- You can query the currently held type using the `std::holds_alternative` function.
- `std::get` and `std::get_if` are used to retrieve the contained value.
- If an inappropriate type access is attempted, `std::get` throws `std::bad_variant_access`.
- It can become valueless_by_exception, for instance, if an exception is thrown during the assignment.

In the code, `std::variant` is used to store and retrieve values of different types. The type of the currently held value is checked using `std::holds_alternative`, and the value itself is accessed using `std::get` and `std::get_if`.

When using `std::variant`, you can rely on the type system to ensure safety, making it a powerful tool for cases where a variable might need to hold different types during its lifetime. It's worth noting, however, that `std::variant` has some overhead compared to regular types, so it's essential to consider its trade-offs.
