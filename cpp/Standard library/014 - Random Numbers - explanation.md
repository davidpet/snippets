## Random Numbers in the C++ Standard Library

### Overview

The C++ standard library offers powerful tools for generating random numbers through the `<random>` header. By mixing and matching various engines and distributions, you can fine-tune the random number generation to your specific needs.

### Key Components:
1. **Engines**: Sources of randomness. They define the algorithm to generate raw random numbers.
    - Common engines include: `std::mt19937` (Mersenne Twister) and `std::default_random_engine`.
2. **Distributions**: Transform the uniformly distributed random numbers produced by engines into numbers that adhere to specific statistical distributions.
    - Common distributions: `std::uniform_int_distribution`, `std::uniform_real_distribution`, and `std::normal_distribution`.

### Simplified Random Number Generation:

For many common tasks, one can use the `std::default_random_engine` (which is typically an alias to one of the standard engines, such as Mersenne Twister) and `std::uniform_int_distribution` or `std::uniform_real_distribution` for integer or floating-point numbers respectively.

### Notes:

- `std::random_device` can provide a non-deterministic seed. Depending on the implementation, it might utilize hardware sources or system libraries.
- For cryptographic applications, the standard random facilities might be insufficient. In such cases, a dedicated cryptographic library is advisable.
