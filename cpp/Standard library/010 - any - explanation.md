## `std::any` in C++

`std::any` is a type-safe container for single values of any type. It was introduced in C++17 and can store any copy-constructible value. This makes it useful when you want a variable that can hold values of different types during its lifetime.

The primary use-case for `std::any` is scenarios where you don't know the type of data you'll receive, such as in some generic or dynamically-typed situations.

### Key member functions:
- `emplace<Type>()`: Store a value of the given type.
- `has_value()`: Check if the `std::any` object contains a value.
- `type()`: Get the `type_info` of the stored value.
- `reset()`: Clear the contents of the `std::any` object.

To retrieve the stored value, you'd typically use `std::any_cast`.

In the code, `std::any` is used to store values of different types, and we also check its type and empty its content.

Remember: Misusing `std::any_cast` (i.e., trying to cast to an incorrect type) will throw a `std::bad_any_cast` exception, so always be careful with it!

`std::any` is a powerful utility, but it comes with some overhead and should be used judiciously. Prefer strong typing where possible, and only resort to `std::any` when the flexibility it provides is genuinely needed.
