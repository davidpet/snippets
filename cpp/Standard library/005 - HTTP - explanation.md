# HTTP

C++ does not have built-in support for HTTP in its standard library. However, there are several third-party libraries available that provide HTTP functionality. One of the most popular ones is libcurl, which is a free and easy-to-use client-side URL transfer library, supporting a lot of protocols including HTTP.
