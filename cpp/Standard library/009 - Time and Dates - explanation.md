# Time and Dates

1. The `std::chrono::system_clock::now()` function is used to get the current time point.
2. The `std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t()` function is used to convert a time point to `time_t` for compatibility with C functions.
3. The `std::localtime()` function is used to convert `time_t` to `tm` struct for more detailed information.
4. The `std::put_time()` function is used to format the time.
5. The `std::chrono::duration` class template is used to represent time intervals. In this example, it is used to represent one day.
6. The `+` operator is used to add a duration to a time point. In this example, it is used to calculate the time for tomorrow.
