## Measuring Time Durations with `std::chrono::high_resolution_clock`

The `std::chrono::high_resolution_clock` is a clock with the shortest tick period. It's the most suitable tool for timing intervals in C++.

This program measures the time it takes to run a loop and then displays the time in microseconds.

Please note that the actual precision depends on your system's hardware and operating system. Always ensure to test and verify the precision and suitability for your specific needs.
