# Observables/Reactive Programming

C++ does not natively support Observables/Reactive Programming in its standard library. However, there are third-party libraries such as RxCpp (Reactive Extensions for C++) that provide this functionality.

Note: RxCpp is a third-party library and is not part of the C++ standard library. It provides a set of algorithms for values-distributed-in-time, which are often used in interactive and concurrent programming. It is a C++ implementation of Reactive Extensions (Rx) library which was first implemented for .NET.
