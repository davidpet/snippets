I'm sorry for the confusion, but C++ Standard Library does not have a concept of "Events" like some other languages such as C# or JavaScript do. The C++ Standard Library provides a set of common classes and interfaces that greatly extend the core C++ language, including containers and algorithms, but it does not provide a built-in event system.

However, you can implement an event system in C++ using various techniques such as function pointers, functors, or modern features like std::function and lambda expressions. Here is a simple example of an event system using std::function and std::vector:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <functional>

// Define an Event class
class Event {
public:
    // Define the event type as a std::function that takes no arguments and returns void
    typedef std::function<void()> FuncType;

    // Add a listener to the event
    void addListener(FuncType listener) {
        listeners.push_back(listener);
    }

    // Trigger the event
    void trigger() {
        for (auto& listener : listeners) {
            listener(); // Call the listener
        }
    }

private:
    // List of listeners
    std::vector<FuncType> listeners;
};

int main() {
    // Create an event
    Event event;

    // Add a listener to the event
    event.addListener([]() {
        std::cout << "Event triggered!" << std::endl; // This will be printed when the event is triggered
    });

    // Trigger the event
    event.trigger();

    return 0;
}

This code defines an `Event` class that can have listeners added to it. Each listener is a function that takes no arguments and returns void. When the `trigger` method is called on the `Event`, it calls all of the listeners.

This is a very simple event system and does not include features that you might find in more complex systems, such as the ability to remove listeners or to stop event propagation. However, it demonstrates the basic concept of how you can implement an event system in C++.
