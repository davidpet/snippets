# Paths and Environment Variables
This code snippet demonstrates how to get environment variables using `std::getenv` and how to manipulate paths using `std::filesystem::path`. The `std::getenv` function returns a pointer to the value of the environment variable, or `nullptr` if the environment variable is not found. The `std::filesystem::path` class provides several member functions to manipulate paths, such as `root_name`, `root_directory`, `relative_path`, `parent_path`, and `filename`.
