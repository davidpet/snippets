# Variables
In the above code, we have four variables: `myInt`, `myFloat`, `myChar`, and `myBool`. Each variable is preceded by a comment that describes the variable's name, type, and purpose. This is a simple way to document your variables in C++. 

Note that C++ supports two types of comments: single-line comments that start with `//` and multi-line comments that start with `/*` and end with `*/`. You can use either type of comment to document your variables, depending on how much information you need to include.

Also note that the `std::boolalpha` manipulator is used to print the boolean value as `true` or `false` instead of `1` or `0`. This can make your output more readable.
