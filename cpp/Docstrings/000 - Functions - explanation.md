# Functions
In the above code, we have a function `add` that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. The function is documented using a multi-line comment that starts with `/**` and ends with `*/`. This is a common style of documentation in C++ and many other languages.

The `@param` tags are used to document the parameters of the function. Each `@param` tag is followed by the name of the parameter and a description of what it does.

The `@return` tag is used to document what the function returns.

In the `main` function, we call the `add` function with the arguments 5 and 7, and print the result. The expected output is 12.

This style of documentation is not enforced by the C++ language itself, but it is widely used and supported by many documentation tools like Doxygen. These tools can parse the comments and generate documentation in various formats like HTML, PDF, etc.

It's important to note that the comments should be kept up-to-date with the code. If the code changes but the comments don't, the comments can become misleading and cause confusion.
