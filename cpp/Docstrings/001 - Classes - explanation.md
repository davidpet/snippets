# Classes

In the code, we have a `Rectangle` class with two private attributes: `width` and `height`. The class has a constructor that takes two parameters: `w` and `h`, which are used to initialize the `width` and `height` of the rectangle, respectively. The class also has two methods: `area` and `perimeter`, which calculate and return the area and perimeter of the rectangle, respectively.

The comments above the class, the constructor, and the methods are used to document what they do, what parameters they take (if any), and what they return (if anything). These comments are not required by the C++ language, but they can be very helpful for other programmers who are trying to understand your code.

In the `main` function, we create a `Rectangle` object with a width of 3.0 and a height of 4.0. We then print the area and perimeter of the rectangle, which should be 12.0 and 14.0, respectively.
