C++ does not natively support docstrings like Python. However, it does have a similar concept known as comments. Comments in C++ are used to provide information about lines of code, functions, variables and other aspects of the code. They are ignored by the compiler and do not affect the execution of the program.

There are two types of comments in C++: single-line comments and multi-line comments. Single-line comments start with `//` and continue until the end of the line. Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. They can span multiple lines.

Here is an example of how you might use comments to document a file or package in C++:

/*
 * File: example.cpp
 * Author: Your Name
 * Date: Date of creation
 * 
 * This file demonstrates the use of comments in C++ for documentation.
 * It includes a function that adds two integers.
 */

#include <iostream>

// This function adds two integers and returns the result.
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 3);
    std::cout << result << std::endl;  // This should print 8.
    return 0;
}

In this example, the multi-line comment at the top of the file provides information about the file, including the author and date of creation. It also gives a brief description of what the file does.

The single-line comment above the `add` function explains what the function does. This is useful for anyone reading the code who wants to understand what the function does without having to read through its implementation.

The single-line comment at the end of the `std::cout` line explains what the expected output of the line is.

While C++ does not have built-in support for docstrings, there are tools available, such as Doxygen, that can generate documentation from specially-formatted comments. These tools support a variety of comment formats and can generate documentation in several formats, including HTML and LaTeX.
