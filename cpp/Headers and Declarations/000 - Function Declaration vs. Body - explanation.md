# Function Declaration vs. Body
In C++, a function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.

The C++ programming language allows functions to be defined in two parts â€” the function declaration and the function body. The function declaration (also known as the function prototype) is where you declare the types of your function's parameters and its return type. The function body is where you define what your function does.

In the provided code, we have demonstrated function declarations and bodies with no parameters, with parameters, and with default parameters. We have also shown how to call these functions in the main function. The 'printHello' function prints a string, the 'add' function returns the sum of two numbers, and the 'multiply' function returns the product of two numbers. If the second parameter is not provided for the 'multiply' function, it will be considered as 2.
