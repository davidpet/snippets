# Forward Declarations
In the above code, we have demonstrated the use of forward declarations in C++. Forward declarations are a way to tell the compiler about the existence of an identifier before actually defining it. This is useful in situations where you have circular dependencies between classes or when you want to reduce compile times by avoiding unnecessary includes.

The code starts with forward declarations of a function, a class, and an enum. Then, in the main function, we use these forward-declared identifiers. After the main function, we provide the actual definitions of the forward-declared identifiers.

Note that for the class, we only create a pointer to an instance of the class. This is because with only a forward declaration, the compiler doesn't know the size of the class, so we can't create an actual instance of the class. However, pointers are always the same size, so we can create a pointer to an instance of the class.

For the enum, we assign one of its values to a variable. This is possible because the size of an enum is known even with only a forward declaration.

Finally, we define the function, class, and enum after the main function. This is possible because we have already told the compiler about their existence with the forward declarations.
