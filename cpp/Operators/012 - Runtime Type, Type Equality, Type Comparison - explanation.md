# Runtime Type/Type Equality/Type Comparison
In the above code, we are demonstrating the use of `typeid` and `dynamic_cast` for runtime type checking and type comparison in C++. 

The `typeid` operator is used to determine the class of an object at runtime. It returns a `type_info` object representing the type of the expression. For polymorphic types (classes with virtual functions), it returns the most derived type (the type of the complete object); for non-polymorphic types, it returns the static type.

The `type_info` objects can be compared for equality or inequality using the `==` and `!=` operators. 

`dynamic_cast` is used for converting pointers and references to classes up, down, and sideways along the inheritance hierarchy. It performs a runtime check: if the object pointed or referred to by the source pointer or reference is not an instance of the target type, the dynamic_cast expression returns a null pointer.

In the code, we first create two pointers, `base` and `derived`, pointing to `Base` and `Derived` objects respectively. We then use `typeid` to print the types of the objects they point to. 

Next, we compare the types of the objects pointed to by `base` and `derived` using `typeid` and the `==` operator. 

Finally, we attempt to use `dynamic_cast` to cast `base` to a `Derived*`. Since `base` actually points to a `Base` object, this cast is not possible, and `dynamic_cast` returns a null pointer.
