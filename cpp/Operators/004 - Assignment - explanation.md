# Assignment

The code demonstrates the use of assignment operators in C++. The assignment operator (`=`) assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand. There are also compound assignment operators that perform an operation and assignment in one step. These include `+=` (addition), `-=` (subtraction), `*=` (multiplication), `/=` (division), and `%=` (modulus). 

In addition to these, there are also bitwise assignment operators. These operators perform bitwise operations and then assign the result to the left operand. These include `&=` (bitwise AND), `|=` (bitwise OR), `^=` (bitwise XOR), `<<=` (left shift), and `>>=` (right shift). 

In the code, each operator is demonstrated with a simple example, and the result is printed to the console. The expected output is also commented at the end of each print line.
