# Reflection
In this code, we first define a struct `Person` with two members: `name` and `age`. We then use the `BOOST_HANA_DEFINE_STRUCT` macro to enable reflection for this struct. This macro generates some code that allows Boost.Hana to know about the members of the struct.

In the `main` function, we create an instance of `Person` and then use the `hana::for_each` function to iterate over the members of the struct. The `hana::first` function returns the name of the member and `hana::second` function returns its value. We print these to the console.

Please note that this is a very basic example and reflection in C++ can get quite complex, especially when dealing with inheritance, templates, and other advanced features of the language. Also, keep in mind that reflection can have a significant impact on compile times and runtime performance, so it should be used judiciously.
