# Comparison
In the above code, we have demonstrated the use of comparison operators in C++. These operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result. The operators demonstrated are:

1. Equal to (==): Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true.
2. Not equal to (!=): Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.
3. Greater than (>): Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.
4. Less than (<): Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.
5. Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.
6. Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true.

The result of these operations is a boolean value, where '1' represents true and '0' represents false.
