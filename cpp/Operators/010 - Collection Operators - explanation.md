# Collection Operators
In the above code, we have demonstrated the usage of the following functions and operators on a vector:

- `push_back`: This function is used to add an element to the end of the vector.
- `[]`: This operator is used to access elements at a specific index in the vector.
- `size`: This function is used to get the number of elements in the vector.
- `front`: This function is used to get the first element in the vector.
- `back`: This function is used to get the last element in the vector.
- `pop_back`: This function is used to remove the last element from the vector.
- `clear`: This function is used to remove all elements from the vector.

These are some of the most commonly used functions and operators on vectors in C++. There are many more functions provided by the vector library in C++, such as `insert`, `erase`, `swap`, `resize`, and `empty`, among others.
