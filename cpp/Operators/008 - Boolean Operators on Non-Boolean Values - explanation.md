# Boolean Operators on Non-Boolean Values
In the above code, we have demonstrated the use of boolean operators on non-boolean values in C++. We have used both logical and bitwise operators. Logical operators consider any non-zero value as true and zero as false. Bitwise operators perform operations on the binary representations of the numbers. The bitwise NOT operator is a unary operator that flips the bits of its operand.
