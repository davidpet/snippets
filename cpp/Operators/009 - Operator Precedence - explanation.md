# Operator Precedence

In the code, we have demonstrated the concept of operator precedence in C++. The precedence of operators determines the order in which the operations are performed in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first. For example, multiplication (*) and division (/) operators have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-) operators. 

Parentheses can be used to change the order of evaluation. The operations inside the parentheses are performed first. 

When operators have the same precedence level, the order of evaluation is from left to right. 

The assignment operator (=) has lower precedence than other operators, so the right-hand side of the assignment is evaluated first. 

This code snippet covers the basic concept of operator precedence in C++. However, there are many more operators in C++ with different precedence levels. For a complete understanding, refer to a comprehensive C++ operator precedence table.
