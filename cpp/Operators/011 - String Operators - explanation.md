# String Operators

In the code, we have demonstrated the use of string operators in C++. 

1. The '+' operator is used for string concatenation. It combines two strings into one. 
2. The '+=' operator also concatenates two strings, but it modifies the original string.
3. The '==' operator checks if two strings are equal. It returns true if they are equal, and false otherwise.
4. The '!=' operator checks if two strings are not equal. It returns true if they are not equal, and false otherwise.
5. The '<' operator checks if the first string is lexicographically less than the second string. It returns true if it is, and false otherwise.
6. The '>' operator checks if the first string is lexicographically greater than the second string. It returns true if it is, and false otherwise.
7. The '<=' operator checks if the first string is lexicographically less than or equal to the second string. It returns true if it is, and false otherwise.
8. The '>=' operator checks if the first string is lexicographically greater than or equal to the second string. It returns true if it is, and false otherwise.

These operators are very useful in manipulating and comparing strings in C++.
