C++ does not natively support reflection, which is the ability of a program to inspect its own structure. However, there are libraries and techniques that can be used to achieve similar functionality. One such library is the Boost.Hana library. Here is an example of how you might use it to implement reflection in C++.

#include <boost/hana.hpp>
#include <iostream>

namespace hana = boost::hana;

// Define a struct with some members
struct Person {
    BOOST_HANA_DEFINE_STRUCT(Person,
        (std::string, name),
        (int, age)
    );
};

int main() {
    // Create an instance of Person
    Person john{"John", 30};

    // Use Boost.Hana to iterate over the members of the struct
    hana::for_each(john, [](auto pair) {
        std::cout << hana::to<char const*>(hana::first(pair)) << ": " << hana::second(pair) << '\n';
        // This will print the name of the member and its value
    });

    return 0;
}
