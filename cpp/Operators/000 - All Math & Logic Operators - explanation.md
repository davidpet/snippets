# All Math & Logic Operators
This code snippet demonstrates the usage of various math and logic operators in C++. 

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%). 

Increment (++) and decrement (--) operators are used to increase or decrease the value of an integer by 1.

Relational operators are used to compare two values. These include equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).

Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions. Logical AND (&&) returns true if both conditions are true. Logical OR (||) returns true if at least one condition is true. Logical NOT (!) returns the opposite of the condition.
