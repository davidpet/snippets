# Bitwise
The above code demonstrates the use of bitwise operators in C++. Bitwise operators are used to perform manipulation of individual bits of a number. They can be used when performing low-level programming, such as writing device drivers, low-level graphics, network protocol packet decoders, etc.

The bitwise AND operator (&) takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.

The bitwise OR operator (|) takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1.

The bitwise XOR operator (^) takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different.

The bitwise NOT operator (~) takes one number and inverts all bits of it.

The bitwise left shift operator (<<) moves the bits of the number to the left by the specified number of places. Each left shift doubles the number, hence it is a quick way to multiply a number by 2.

The bitwise right shift operator (>>) moves the bits of the number to the right by the specified number of places. Each right shift halves the number, hence it is a quick way to divide a number by 2.
