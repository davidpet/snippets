# Namespaces
In the above code, we have demonstrated the usage of namespaces in C++. We started with a simple namespace declaration and usage, then moved on to the 'using' directive, nested namespaces, unnamed namespaces, and finally inline namespaces. Each of these concepts is demonstrated with a simple example and a print statement to show the output.
