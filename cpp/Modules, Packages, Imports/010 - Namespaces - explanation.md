# Namespaces

In the code, we have demonstrated the usage of namespaces in C++. We started with a simple namespace declaration and usage, then moved on to the 'using' directive, nested namespaces, unnamed namespaces, and finally inline namespaces. Each of these concepts is demonstrated with a simple example and a print statement to show the output.

Note: you could use `using namespace` to import all symbols from a namespace to the global namespace.

Note: you can add to any namespace you want, including `std` if you really wanted.

Note: when inside a namespace block, you can see the other members unqualified.
