In this example, the `#include <iostream>` directive tells the compiler to include the `iostream` header file from the system directories. This file contains the declaration of the `std::cout` object, which is used to print to the console.

The `#include "my_header.h"` directive tells the compiler to include the `my_header.h` file from the current directory or any directories specified with the `-I` command line option. This file should contain the declaration of the `my_function` function.

The `std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;` line uses the `std::cout` object to print "Hello, world!" to the console. The `std::endl` manipulator is used to insert a newline character and flush the output buffer.

The `my_function();` line calls the `my_function` function, which should be defined in the `my_header.h` file or another file that is included by `my_header.h`.

The `return 0;` line indicates that the program has finished successfully. If the program encounters an error, it should return a non-zero value to indicate this.
