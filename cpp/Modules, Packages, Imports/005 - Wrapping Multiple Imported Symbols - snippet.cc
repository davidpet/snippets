C++ does not have a built-in module/package system like Python or Java. However, it does have a system for including other files, which is often used to create a similar effect. The `#include` directive is used to include the contents of another file at that point in the program. 

In C++, the `#include` directive is used to import symbols from other files. The `#include` directive essentially copies and pastes the content of the included file into the source file before compilation. 

Here is an example of how you might wrap multiple imported symbols in C++:

// File: my_library.h
#ifndef MY_LIBRARY_H
#define MY_LIBRARY_H

// Declare some functions
int add(int a, int b);
int subtract(int a, int b);

#endif

// File: my_library.cpp
#include "my_library.h"

// Define the functions
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int subtract(int a, int b) {
    return a - b;
}

// File: main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "my_library.h"

int main() {
    // Use the imported symbols
    std::cout << add(1, 2) << std::endl; // Prints: 3
    std::cout << subtract(5, 3) << std::endl; // Prints: 2

    return 0;
}

In this example, the `my_library.h` file declares two functions, `add` and `subtract`. The `my_library.cpp` file includes `my_library.h` and defines these functions. The `main.cpp` file then includes `my_library.h` and uses these functions.

The `#ifndef`, `#define`, and `#endif` directives in `my_library.h` are used to prevent multiple inclusion. If `my_library.h` is included more than once, these directives ensure that its contents are only included the first time. This is important because including the same declarations multiple times can cause errors.
