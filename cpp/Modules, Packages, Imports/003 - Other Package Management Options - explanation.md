# Other Package Management Options
As for package management, let's take a look at how you might use Conan, a popular C++ package manager. First, you would install Conan, then you would create a `conanfile.txt` in your project directory:

```txt
[requires]
poco/1.9.4

[generators]
cmake
```

This file specifies that your project requires the Poco library version 1.9.4, and that you are using CMake to build your project.

Then, you would run `conan install .` in your project directory to install the required packages.

Finally, in your `CMakeLists.txt`, you would include the following lines:

```txt
include(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/conanbuildinfo.cmake)
conan_basic_setup()
```

This tells CMake to use the packages installed by Conan.

Please note that this is a very basic example. Conan, vcpkg, and CMake all have many more features and options available.
