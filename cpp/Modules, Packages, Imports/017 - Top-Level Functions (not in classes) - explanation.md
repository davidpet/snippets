# Top-Level Functions (not in classes)
In C++, top-level functions are functions that are not part of any class. They can be defined anywhere in the code, but they are usually defined at the top of the file, before the `main` function. 

Top-level functions can take any number of arguments and can return a value. The type of the return value is specified before the function name. If the function does not return a value, the return type is `void`.

In the code above, we have three top-level functions: `sayHello`, `printNumber`, and `addNumbers`. The `sayHello` function does not take any arguments and does not return a value. The `printNumber` function takes one argument, an integer, and does not return a value. The `addNumbers` function takes two arguments, both integers, and returns their sum.

The `main` function is also a top-level function. It is the entry point of the program and is called automatically when the program starts. The `main` function can call other top-level functions, as demonstrated in the code above.
