# Importing Built-In Libraries
In the above code, we have demonstrated how to import and use built-in libraries in C++. The `#include` directive is used to import a library. We have imported the `iostream` library for input/output operations, the `cmath` library for mathematical operations, and the `string` library for string types.

In the `main` function, we have used the `std::cout` object from the `iostream` library to print to the console, the `pow` function from the `cmath` library to calculate the power of a number, and the `std::string` type from the `string` library.

Note that when using a function or an object from a library, we need to prefix it with the `std::` namespace. This is because the standard C++ libraries are defined in the `std` namespace.
