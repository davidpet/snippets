# Renaming Imported Symbols
In the above code, we first define a module `my_module` with a function `my_function`. In the `main.cpp` file, we import `my_module` and create an alias `renamed_function` for `my_module::my_function`. This effectively "renames" the imported symbol.

Please note that this is a workaround and not a direct feature of the C++ language. The alias is not a new symbol but a new name for an existing symbol in the current scope. Therefore, it does not affect the original module or any other code that imports the same module.

Also, remember that the alias has the same access level as the original symbol. If the original symbol is private, the alias cannot be used outside the module. If the original symbol is public, the alias can be used anywhere the original symbol can be used.

This workaround can be used for any symbol, not just functions. You can create aliases for variables, classes, etc. However, you cannot create aliases for namespaces or modules themselves.
