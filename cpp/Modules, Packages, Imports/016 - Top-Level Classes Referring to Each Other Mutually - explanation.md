# Top-Level Classes Referring to Each Other Mutually
In the above code, we have two classes A and B. Class A needs to refer to class B in its method `printB()`, but class B is not defined yet. To solve this problem, we use a forward declaration of class B. This tells the compiler that class B exists and it will be defined later. Then we define class A with a pointer to an object of class B as a member. After that, we define class B. Finally, we implement the `printB()` method of class A that uses class B. This method is implemented outside the class definition because it needs the complete definition of class B.

In the `main()` function, we create an object of class B with the value 10 and an object of class A that refers to the object of class B. Then we call the `printB()` method of class A to print the value of class B.

Note that forward declarations can only be used if the complete type of the class is not required. In this case, class A only needs to know that class B is a class and it has a method `getValue()`. The complete definition of class B is not required in the definition of class A. However, the complete definition is required in the implementation of the `printB()` method, so it is implemented after the definition of class B.
