I'm sorry for the confusion, but the concept of "Barrelling" is not applicable to the C++ programming language. Barrelling is a term used in JavaScript and TypeScript to describe a way to rollup exports from several modules into a single module. This concept is used to simplify imports in these languages.

C++ has a different approach to handling modules and imports. It uses the `#include` directive to include header files, and the concept of namespaces to avoid name conflicts. However, C++20 introduced a new feature called "modules" which is a new way to share code between source files, but it doesn't have a direct equivalent to "barrelling".

If you need an example of how to use `#include` directives, namespaces or C++20 modules, I'd be happy to provide that.
