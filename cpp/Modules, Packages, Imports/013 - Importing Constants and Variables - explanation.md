# Importing Constants and Variables
In the above code, we first define some constants and variables in `constants.h` and `variables.h` respectively. We then include these files in `main.cpp` using the `#include` directive. This allows us to use the constants and variables defined in these files in our `main.cpp` file.

Note that we use `#ifndef`, `#define`, and `#endif` to prevent multiple inclusion of the same header file. This is known as an include guard. If the header file is included multiple times, the preprocessor will ignore all but the first inclusion.

Also note that defining variables in header files is generally not a good practice, because it can lead to multiple definition errors if the header file is included in multiple source files. A better approach would be to declare the variables in the header file using the `extern` keyword, and then define them in a single source file.
