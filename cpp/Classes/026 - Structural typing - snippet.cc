C++ is a statically typed language, which means it does not support structural typing directly. Structural typing is a way of typing in which types are equivalent if they have the same structure, not based on their name or their declaration. This is more common in dynamically typed languages like Python or JavaScript.

However, C++ does have a feature that is somewhat similar to structural typing, which is called Duck Typing. Duck Typing is a concept where the semantics of an object is determined by its current set of methods and properties, not by its inheritance from a particular class. This is done using templates in C++.

Here is an example of how you can achieve something similar to structural typing in C++ using templates:

#include <iostream>

// Define a class with a specific structure
class Duck {
public:
    void quack() {
        std::cout << "Quack!" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Define another class with the same structure
class NotADuck {
public:
    void quack() {
        std::cout << "I'm not a duck, but I can quack!" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Define a function that accepts any type of object that has a quack method
template <typename T>
void makeItQuack(T duckLikeObject) {
    duckLikeObject.quack(); // This will print depending on the object's quack method
}

int main() {
    Duck duck;
    NotADuck notADuck;

    makeItQuack(duck); // Prints: Quack!
    makeItQuack(notADuck); // Prints: I'm not a duck, but I can quack!
    return 0;
}
