# Interface Members Other Than Public Abstract Methods
In this code snippet, we define an interface `IShape` with various types of members other than public abstract methods. 

1. Public non-abstract methods: These are methods that provide a default implementation. In this case, `printName()` is a public non-abstract method that calls the abstract method `getName()` to print the name of the shape.

2. Protected methods: These are methods that are only accessible within the class and its subclasses. Here, `getName()` is a protected abstract method that is implemented by the `Circle` class.

3. Public static methods: These are methods that belong to the class itself, not any particular object of the class. `printInterfaceName()` is a public static method that prints the name of the interface.

4. Public data members: These are variables that are accessible from anywhere. `id` is a public data member that is accessible from the `main()` function.

The `Circle` class implements the `IShape` interface by providing an implementation for the `draw()` and `getName()` methods. In the `main()` function, we create a `Circle` object, assign a value to its `id`, and call its methods to demonstrate the usage of the interface members.
