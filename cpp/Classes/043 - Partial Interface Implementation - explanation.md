# Partial Interface Implementation
In the above code, we first define an interface `IShape` with two pure virtual functions `draw` and `rotate`. 

Then we create a class `PartialShape` that inherits from `IShape` and implements the `draw` function. This is a partial implementation of the `IShape` interface because it does not implement the `rotate` function.

Finally, we create a class `FullShape` that inherits from `PartialShape` and implements the `rotate` function. This is a full implementation of the `IShape` interface because it implements both the `draw` and `rotate` functions.

In the `main` function, we create an instance of `FullShape` and call both `draw` and `rotate` functions. The output of this program will be:

```
Drawing a shape
Rotating a shape
```

This demonstrates the concept of partial interface implementation in C++. The `PartialShape` class provides a partial implementation of the `IShape` interface, and the `FullShape` class provides a full implementation.
