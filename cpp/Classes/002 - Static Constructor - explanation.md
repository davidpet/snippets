# Static Constructor
In this code, `MyClass::staticMember` is a static member object of `MyClass`. It is initialized before `main()` is called, so its constructor is effectively a "static constructor". When you run this code, you will see that "Regular constructor called" is printed before "Main function started", demonstrating that the static member object's constructor was called before `main()`.

This technique can be used to perform setup tasks that need to be done before any objects of the class are created. However, it's important to note that the order of initialization of static objects in different translation units is not defined in C++, so if you have static objects in different source files that depend on each other, you may run into problems.

Also, this technique should be used sparingly, as it can make the code harder to understand and maintain. In many cases, there are better ways to achieve the same result, such as using a singleton pattern or simply ensuring that the necessary setup is done before creating any objects.
