# Locally Declared Class

Although you can't declare a function inside a function body, you can declare a class that way.

This can be used to do an __anonymous class__ similar to C# and Java, except it's not quite as functional.  For instance, it __cannot close around data__ as shown in the example. So it's basically the same as just defining the class somewhere else.
