### vtables in C++

The term "vtable" stands for "virtual table," and it's a mechanism used by C++ compilers to support dynamic dispatch (or runtime polymorphism) when we have virtual functions in classes.

#### Basic Structure of a vtable

For every class that has at least one virtual function, the compiler generates a vtable. The vtable is simply an array of function pointers. Each entry in this table is a function pointer pointing to the most derived function accessible by that class.

#### Basic Inheritance

Let's consider a simple inheritance scenario:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void func() { /*...*/ }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void func() override { /*...*/ }
};
```

- For `Base`, the compiler generates a vtable (let's call it `vtable_Base`) which has one entry pointing to `Base::func`.
  
- For `Derived`, the compiler generates another vtable (`vtable_Derived`). Since `Derived` overrides `func`, the entry in `vtable_Derived` for `func` points to `Derived::func`.

When you create an object of `Derived` and call `func` via a pointer of type `Base*`, the call gets dispatched to the correct function using the vtable of `Derived`.

#### Diamond Inheritance

Now, let's consider a more complex diamond inheritance scenario:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void func() { /*...*/ }
};

class Derived1 : virtual public Base {
public:
    void func() override { /*...*/ }
};

class Derived2 : virtual public Base {
};

class MostDerived : public Derived1, public Derived2 {
};
```

In this setup:

- `Base`, `Derived1`, and `Derived2` will each have their own vtables.
  
- `MostDerived` will have its own vtable but will inherit the `func` from `Derived1` due to the override.

Diamond inheritance with virtual base classes involves an added level of complexity. The compiler has to ensure that only one instance of the `Base` class is present in `MostDerived` (to avoid the "dreaded diamond" problem). This leads to more complex vtable setups, potentially involving adjustments to the `this` pointer (often referred to as "thunks").

#### Thunking

Thunks are small code adjustments generated by compilers to adjust the `this` pointer. They are required in scenarios where multiple inheritance changes the layout of the final object in memory.

In our diamond example, if `MostDerived` contains additional data members or functions, the memory layout of a `MostDerived` object changes. When calling a `Base` function on a `MostDerived` object through a `Derived1` or `Derived2` pointer, the compiler might need to adjust the `this` pointer so that it correctly points to the `Base` subobject. This adjustment is the "thunk."

In essence, thunks handle the difference in memory layout due to complex inheritance hierarchies. 

#### Incremental Construction

vtables are constructed incrementally during construction, so base members may temporarily point to less derived implementations if called during construction.

#### Overall Class Layout

The C++ standard doesn't specify how a class should be laid out with regard to its vtable, but a common way compilers do it is to put a __vptr__ at the beginning of the class pointing to the class's vtable.

### Conclusion

vtables are crucial for C++'s implementation of dynamic polymorphism. While the idea is conceptually simple—an array of function pointers—it gets intricate when multiple and virtual inheritance come into play. Nevertheless, understanding how vtables work gives deeper insight into the C++ object model and its performance characteristics.
