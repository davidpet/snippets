# Basic Syntax and Instantiation

In the code, we define a class `MyClass` with an instance variable `instanceVar`, a static variable `staticVar`, a constructor, an instance method `printInstanceVar()`, and a static method `printStaticVar()`.

We then instantiate two objects of `MyClass`, `obj1` and `obj2`, with `instanceVar` values of 10 and 20 respectively. Each time an object is instantiated, the constructor increments `staticVar`.

We then demonstrate accessing instance variables, which are unique to each object, and the static variable, which is shared across all objects of the class.

Finally, we demonstrate calling instance methods, which can access instance variables, and static methods, which can only access static variables.
