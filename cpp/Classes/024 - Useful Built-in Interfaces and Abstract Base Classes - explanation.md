# Useful Built-in Interfaces and Abstract Base Classes
In the above code, `AbstractClass` is an abstract base class with a pure virtual function `myVirtualFunction()`. This function is overridden in the derived classes `SubClass1` and `SubClass2`, each providing a different implementation. The `normalFunction()` is a regular member function of the abstract base class, and it can be called directly from the objects of the derived classes. 

This is how we can create and use abstract base classes in C++, which serve a similar purpose to interfaces in other languages. They provide a contract that the derived classes must follow, ensuring a certain level of uniformity in the way different classes are used.
