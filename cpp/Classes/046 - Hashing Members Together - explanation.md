# Hashing Members Together
In this code, we define a class `MyClass` with two members: an integer `a` and a string `b`. We then define a method `hashMembers` that hashes these members together. This is done by first hashing each member individually using `std::hash`, and then combining these hashes using the bitwise XOR operator `^`. The left shift operator `<<` is used to ensure that the hashes of the two members do not simply cancel each other out.

In the `main` function, we create two instances of `MyClass` and print their hashes. The output will be two unique hash values, one for each object.

This is a simple example, and in a real-world scenario, you might have more members and more complex types. The general principle, however, remains the same: hash each member individually, and then combine these hashes in a way that ensures a unique hash for each unique combination of member values.
