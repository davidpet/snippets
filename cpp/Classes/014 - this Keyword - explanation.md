# this Keyword

In this code, we have a class `MyClass` with a member variable `myVar`. The `this` keyword is used in the constructor to distinguish between the class member `myVar` and the constructor argument `a`. The `this` keyword is also used in the `getThis()` method to return a pointer to the current instance of the class, and in the `isEqual()` method to compare the current instance with another instance. The `main()` function demonstrates the usage of these methods.

Notes:
1. `this` is a pointer, so to access members you need `->`.
1. `this` is implicit when accessing members - you don't need to keep providing it like in TypeScript.
