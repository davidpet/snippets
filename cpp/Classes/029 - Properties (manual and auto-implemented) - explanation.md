# Properties (manual and auto-implemented)
In the above code, we have a `Person` class with a private `_name` member. We have a getter (`getName()`) and a setter (`setName()`) for this member, which are the manual properties for the `_name` member. We first create a `Person` object with the name "John Doe", print the name, change the name to "Jane Doe", and print the name again.

Now, let's talk about auto-implemented properties. Unfortunately, C++ does not support auto-implemented properties like some other languages (e.g., C#). In C++, you have to manually create getters and setters for each property you want to expose. However, you can use some features of C++ to make this process easier and more automatic, such as macros or code generation tools, but these are outside the scope of this discussion.

In C++, it's also common to directly expose members as public without getters and setters if you don't need to control their access or modify their behavior. This is not exactly the same as auto-implemented properties, but it's a similar concept.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Define a basic class
class Person {
public:
    // Constructor
    Person(std::string name) : name(name) {}

    // Public member
    std::string name;
};

int main() {
    // Create a new person
    Person person("John Doe");

    // Print the person's name
    std::cout << person.name << std::endl; // Expected output: John Doe

    // Change the person's name
    person.name = "Jane Doe";

    // Print the person's name again
    std::cout << person.name << std::endl; // Expected output: Jane Doe

    return 0;
}
```

##### In the above code, we have a `Person` class with a public `name` member. We can directly access and modify this member without any getters or setters. This is similar to the concept of auto-implemented properties, but it's not exactly the same because we don't have any control over the access or modification of the member.
