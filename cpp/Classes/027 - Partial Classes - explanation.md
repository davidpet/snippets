# Partial Classes
In the above code, `MyClass` is declared in `MyClass.h` and defined in `MyClass.cpp`. The `main.cpp` file includes `MyClass.h` to use the `MyClass` class. The `myMethod` method of `MyClass` is called, which prints "This is a method of MyClass." to the console.

While C++ does not support partial classes, it does allow for separate compilation. This means that each .cpp file is compiled separately. This can be used to organize code in a similar way to how partial classes are used in other languages. However, all parts of a class must be defined in the same class definition.
