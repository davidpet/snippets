# Object Suicide

"Object suicide" refers to the practice where an object destroys or deletes itself. This can be a bit tricky in C++ due to potential undefined behavior that can arise if you're not careful. Object suicide is commonly seen in event-driven environments or when implementing certain design patterns, but it's important to tread with caution.

### Object Suicide in C++

"Object suicide" typically refers to a scenario where an object deallocates or destroys itself, often in response to some conditions or events. In C++, this is usually done by an object invoking the `delete` keyword on itself.

However, using object suicide in C++ requires careful consideration to avoid undefined behavior. After an object has deleted itself, the rest of the method in which the `delete` was called will still execute, but accessing the object's members or calling its methods will lead to undefined behavior.

Here's a demonstration:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class SuicideObject {
public:
    void doSomething() {
        std::cout << "Doing something..." << std::endl;
        
        // After this condition, the object decides to destroy itself
        if (true) {
            std::cout << "Condition met, committing object suicide..." << std::endl;
            delete this;
            
            // IMPORTANT: After 'delete this', do not access members, methods, or 'this' pointer.
            return; // Ensure the function exits immediately after deletion.
        }
        
        // This line should never be reached after deletion.
        std::cout << "This will never be printed." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    SuicideObject* obj = new SuicideObject();
    obj->doSomething();

    // IMPORTANT: Do not access 'obj' after it has deleted itself.
    // Ideally, set the pointer to null after the object has committed suicide.
    obj = nullptr;

    return 0;
}
```

**Notes**:
1. Always ensure the function exits immediately after `delete this` to avoid accidentally accessing any members or methods.
2. Avoid using the object after it has deleted itself. Ideally, set the pointer to the object to `nullptr` immediately.
3. This pattern is risky and can lead to hard-to-debug issues if not handled carefully. Use it judiciously and ensure there's a good reason to use it over alternative designs.

Remember, while this pattern can be useful in some niche scenarios, in most cases, there are safer and more maintainable design alternatives to object suicide. Consider alternatives like smart pointers, the RAII principle, or redesigning ownership semantics before resorting to this approach.
