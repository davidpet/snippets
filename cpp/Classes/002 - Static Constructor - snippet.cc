In C++, there is no direct concept of a "static constructor" like in some other languages such as C# or Java. A static constructor is a special constructor in some object-oriented programming languages, which is automatically invoked to initialize the class before the first object is created or any static members are referenced.

However, in C++, we can achieve similar functionality using a static member object, which is initialized before main() is called. This can be used to perform some setup tasks that are needed before any objects of the class are created.

Here is an example:

#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    // Regular constructor
    MyClass() {
        std::cout << "Regular constructor called" << std::endl;
    }

    // Static member object
    static MyClass staticMember;
};

// Initialize static member object
MyClass MyClass::staticMember;

int main() {
    std::cout << "Main function started" << std::endl;
    MyClass myObject;
    return 0;
}
