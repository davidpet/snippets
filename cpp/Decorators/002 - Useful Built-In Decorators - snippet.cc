I'm sorry for the confusion, but the concept of "Decorators" as you've described it doesn't exist in C++. Decorators are a feature of some other programming languages like Python, where they allow you to modify the behavior of a function or class. 

In C++, the closest concept might be "Decorators" as a design pattern, which is a way to add new behavior to an object dynamically, without modifying its implementation. This is done by creating a new decorator class that wraps the original class.

Here's an example of how you might implement a decorator pattern in C++:

#include <iostream>

// The 'Component' interface
class Component {
public:
    virtual ~Component() {}
    virtual void operation() const = 0;
};

// Concrete 'Component'
class ConcreteComponent : public Component {
public:
    void operation() const override {
        std::cout << "ConcreteComponent operation" << std::endl; // This will print "ConcreteComponent operation"
    }
};

// The 'Decorator' abstract class
class Decorator : public Component {
protected:
    Component* component;
public:
    Decorator(Component* c) : component(c) {}
    virtual ~Decorator() {}
};

// Concrete 'Decorator'
class ConcreteDecorator : public Decorator {
public:
    ConcreteDecorator(Component* c) : Decorator(c) {}
    void operation() const override {
        std::cout << "Before decoration" << std::endl; // This will print "Before decoration"
        component->operation();
        std::cout << "After decoration" << std::endl; // This will print "After decoration"
    }
};

int main() {
    Component* simple = new ConcreteComponent;
    Component* decorator = new ConcreteDecorator(simple);
    decorator->operation();
    delete decorator;
    delete simple;
    return 0;
}
