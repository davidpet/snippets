# C++20 (2020): Latest version with features like modules, coroutines, concepts, etc.
1. Concepts: Concepts are a way to express type requirements. They are predicates for types. In the code above, we define a concept 'Addable' which checks if a type T can be added to another type T. We then use this concept in a function that adds two 'Addable' types together.

2. Coroutines: Coroutines are functions that can suspend execution to be resumed later. This allows for more efficient code, especially in a single-threaded environment. In the code above, we define a coroutine 'range' that generates numbers from 0 to a given end.

3. Modules: Modules are a way to encapsulate code and reduce compilation times. Unfortunately, they can't be demonstrated in a single file, but the comments in the code show how you'd use them.
