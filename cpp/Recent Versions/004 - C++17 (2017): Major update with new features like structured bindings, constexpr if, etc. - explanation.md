# C++17 (2017): Major update with new features like structured bindings, constexpr if, etc.

C++17 introduced several key features that further improved the language and made it more expressive and convenient for developers. Here's a summary of the important new features in C++17:

## C++17 Important Features

### Language Features:

- **Inline Variables**: It allows variables to be defined in header files without violating the One Definition Rule (ODR).
    ```cpp
    inline int globalVar = 42;
    ```

- **Structured Bindings**: Decompose objects into their individual members.
    ```cpp
    std::pair<int, int> func();
    auto [a, b] = func();
    ```

- **`if constexpr`: Compile-time Conditional**: Simplifies template code by discarding branches of `if` that are not valid for the specified template parameters.
    ```cpp
    template <typename T>
    auto getValue(const T& t) {
        if constexpr (std::is_pointer_v<T>)
            return *t;
        else
            return t;
    }
    ```

- **Fold Expressions**: Simplifies variadic template code.
    ```cpp
    template<typename... T>
    auto sum(T... t) {
        return (... + t); // fold expression
    }
    ```

- **`init` statement for `if` and `switch`**: Helps in narrowing the scope of variables.
    ```cpp
    if (int i = func(); i < threshold) {
        // ...
    }
    ```

- **`[[fallthrough]]`, `[[nodiscard]]`, `[[maybe_unused]]` Attributes**: Additional attributes for better code clarity and warning control.

### Library Features:

- **`std::optional`**: Represents an optional object, a value that might or might not be present.
  
- **`std::variant`**: Represents a type-safe union.
  
- **`std::any`**: Can hold any type of value but lacks type-safety and requires type-casting to retrieve the original value.
  
- **`std::string_view`**: A lightweight, non-owning reference to a string, beneficial for performance.

- **`std::filesystem`**: A comprehensive filesystem library inspired by Boost.Filesystem.

- **`std::byte`**: A distinct type that implements the concept of byte.

- **`std::invoke`, `std::apply`**: Utilities to invoke callable objects in a generic way and apply a tuple to a callable object.

- **`std::clamp`**: Clamps a value between a pair of boundary values.

- **`std::shared_mutex`**: Allows multiple threads to read or single thread to write.

- **Parallel STL Algorithms**: Some algorithms from the `<algorithm>` and `<numeric>` headers now have overloads that accept an execution policy, enabling parallel execution.

- **`std::scoped_lock`**: A convenient RAII wrapper for locking multiple mutexes.

- **`std::from_chars` and `std::to_chars`**: Functions for fast number parsing and formatting.

These are just the major features introduced in C++17. The update brought many refinements, making the language even more powerful and developer-friendly compared to C++14.
