# C++03 (2003): Minor update to C++98.

This code demonstrates the use of vectors and iterators in C++03. The `printVector` function takes a constant reference to a vector and prints its elements. In the `main` function, we create a vector, add some elements to it, and then print it. The `push_back` function is used to add elements to the end of the vector. The `begin` and `end` functions return iterators pointing to the first element and one past the last element of the vector, respectively. The `const_iterator` is a type of iterator that can't modify the elements it points to.
