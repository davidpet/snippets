# C++98 (1998): The first standardized version of C++.
This code snippet demonstrates some of the key features of C++98:

1. **Class Definition**: The class `MyClass` is defined with a constructor and a member function. The constructor initializes the member variable `x_` using an initialization list, which is a feature introduced in C++98.

2. **Function Templates**: The function `add` is a template function, which allows it to operate on any data type.

3. **STL Vector and Iterators**: The Standard Template Library (STL) was standardized in C++98. This code uses an STL `vector` to store integers and an iterator to traverse the vector.

4. **Variable Declaration and Initialization**: The variables `a` and `b` are declared and initialized in the `main` function. This is a basic feature of C++ that was present in C++98.

5. **I/O Streams**: The `iostream` library is used for console input and output. This was also standardized in C++98.

6. **Use of the Class**: An instance of `MyClass` is created and its member function is called.

This code does not cover all features of C++98, but it provides a good overview of some of the key features that were standardized in this version of the language.
