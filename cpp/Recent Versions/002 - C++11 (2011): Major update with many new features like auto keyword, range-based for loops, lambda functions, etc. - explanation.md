# C++11 (2011): Major update with many new features like auto keyword, range-based for loops, lambda functions, etc.
1. The `auto` keyword is a way to let the compiler automatically deduce the type of the variable from its initializer. It can be particularly useful when dealing with long or complex types that are hard to write out manually.

2. Range-based `for` loops are a new kind of for loop that iterate over a range, such as all the elements in a container. They are simpler and less error-prone than traditional for loops.

3. Lambda functions are a new kind of function that can be defined right where they are used. They are particularly useful for short functions that are only used in one place, and can make code more concise and easier to read.
