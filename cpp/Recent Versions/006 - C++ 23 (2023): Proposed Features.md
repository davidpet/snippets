## C++23 Proposed Features

As of early 2022, C++23 hasn't been finalized, but several features are under active discussion:

### 1. Executors
- A framework for managing task execution, such as on specific threads or GPU offloads.

### 2. Reflection
- Enhanced static reflection capabilities for compile-time code introspection and modification.

### 3. Pattern Matching
- Introduce pattern matching on types, inspired by functional languages and others like Rust.

### 4. Coroutines Improvements
- Enhanced usability and performance building upon C++20's introduction of coroutines.

### 5. Networking
- Potential standard networking library based on Boost.ASIO, though inclusion isn't guaranteed.

### 6. Ranges Enhancements
- Extensions and improvements to the C++20 ranges library.

### 7. Contracts
- Effort to reintroduce contracts (preconditions, postconditions) after removal from C++20.

### 8. Modules Improvements
- Refinements based on feedback from C++20's introduction of modules.

### 9. New Standard Library Features
- Additions to `<chrono>`, new algorithms, and more.

### 10. Source Code Information Capture
- Obtain information about the current source code location.

### 11. Text Formatting
- Building on `std::format` from C++20, a proposal exists for `std::print` for direct formatted printing.

**Note**: These features are based on discussions and proposals up to early 2022. Some might be included in C++23, deferred, or modified. For definitive C++23 information, refer to official ISO C++ committee communications.
