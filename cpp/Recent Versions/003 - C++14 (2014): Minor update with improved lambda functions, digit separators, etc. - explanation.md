# C++14 (2014): Minor update with improved lambda functions, digit separators, etc.
1. The first part of the code demonstrates the use of `auto` type parameters in lambda functions. This allows the lambda function to accept parameters of any type.

2. The second part of the code shows the use of single quotes as digit separators. This feature can make large numbers more readable in your code.

3. The third part of the code shows the use of generic lambdas, which can take arguments of any type. This is demonstrated by passing both a string and an integer to the same lambda function.

4. The last part of the code demonstrates the use of lambda capture expressions with the same syntax as `auto` type deduction. This allows you to initialize captured variables with expressions, not just values.
