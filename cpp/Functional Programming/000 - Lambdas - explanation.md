# Lambdas
In the above code, we have demonstrated the use of lambda functions in C++. We started with a basic lambda function that takes two integers and returns their sum. Then we showed how to capture local variables from the surrounding scope, and how to modify these captured variables using the mutable keyword. We also showed how to capture variables by reference, so that changes to the variable inside the lambda function are reflected in the original variable. Finally, we demonstrated how to pass a lambda function as a parameter to another function, in this case to the std::sort function as a custom comparator.
