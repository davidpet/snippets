# Contravariance of Pointers to Members

Contravariance is a type relationship that comes into play with subtyping, particularly with function types in some languages. It describes a situation where, counterintuitively, the "input" side of a function (or callable) can be *broadened* in a subtype (as opposed to the usual expectation of subtypes narrowing or specializing behavior).

In C++, this concept isn't as directly present as in some other languages, but it can be demonstrated using pointers to member functions. Here's an exploration of contravariance with pointers to member functions in C++:

### Contravariance with Pointers to Members in C++

When you have a pointer to a member function of a base class, you can assign it a member function of a derived class, as long as the signature of the derived class's member function can handle *more* (or at least the same) than the base's. This is contravariant behavior.

Here's a demonstration:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base {
public:
    virtual void foo(int x) {
        std::cout << "Base::foo with " << x << std::endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    // Overriding function that can handle more types of arguments
    void foo(double x) override {
        std::cout << "Derived::foo with " << x << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    
    // Pointer to member function of Base that takes an int
    void (Base::*ptr)(int) = &Derived::foo;
    
    // Call the member function using the object and pointer
    (d.*ptr)(5);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this snippet, we've defined a base class `Base` with a virtual function `foo` that takes an `int`. The derived class `Derived` overrides this function with one that takes a `double`. Because `double` can accommodate any `int` value, this is a contravariant change in the argument type.

The key aspect is this line:

```cpp
void (Base::*ptr)(int) = &Derived::foo;
```

We're assigning a pointer to a derived class's member function (that takes a `double`) to a base class's member function pointer type (that expects an `int`). This works because of contravariance: the derived class's function can handle more than the base's function.

Remember, while this demonstrates contravariance in a way, it's a bit of a roundabout way to think about it in C++ and might not always be intuitive. In languages with more explicit support for covariance and contravariance (like some functional languages or languages like C#), this behavior might be more directly apparent.
