# IIFE
In the above code, we have demonstrated the use of IIFE in C++. The first example shows a simple IIFE that returns a value. The second example shows an IIFE that does not capture any variables from the surrounding scope. The third example shows an IIFE that captures variables from the surrounding scope. 

Please note that IIFE is not a common practice in C++, and it is usually used in JavaScript. However, it can be used in C++ in some cases. The main advantage of IIFE is that it allows you to create a new scope, which can be useful in some situations. For example, you can use IIFE to initialize a const variable with a complex expression, or to execute some code immediately while keeping the variables used in the code from polluting the surrounding scope.
