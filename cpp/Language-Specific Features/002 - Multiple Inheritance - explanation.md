# Multiple Inheritance
In the above code, we have two base classes `Animal` and `Mammal`, and a derived class `Dog`. The `Dog` class is derived from both `Animal` and `Mammal` classes, hence it's an example of multiple inheritance. 

The `Dog` class can access the public members of both the `Animal` and `Mammal` classes. In the `main` function, we create an object `d1` of the `Dog` class and call the `eat`, `breathe`, and `bark` methods. 

This is a simple example of multiple inheritance. However, multiple inheritance can get complex when there are conflicts between base classes. For example, if both base classes have a method with the same name, the derived class may not know which one to use. This is known as the Diamond Problem. 

Here is an example demonstrating the Diamond Problem and how to resolve it using virtual inheritance:

```cpp
#include<iostream>

// Base class
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void eat() {
        std::cout << "I can eat!" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Intermediate base class 1
class Dog : virtual public Animal {
};

// Intermediate base class 2
class Cat : virtual public Animal {
};

// Derived class
class DogCat : public Dog, public Cat {
};

int main() {
    DogCat dc;
    dc.eat(); // prints: I can eat!
    return 0;
}
```

#####

In this code, `Dog` and `Cat` are both derived from `Animal` and `DogCat` is derived from both `Dog` and `Cat`. Without virtual inheritance, `DogCat` would have two copies of `Animal`'s members, leading to ambiguity. 

By making `Dog` and `Cat` inherit from `Animal` virtually, we ensure that only one copy of `Animal`'s members is included in `DogCat`. This resolves the ambiguity and allows `DogCat` to call the `eat` method without any issues.
