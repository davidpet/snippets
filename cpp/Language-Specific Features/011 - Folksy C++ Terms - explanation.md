### Popular "Folksy" C++ Terms

1. **Object Suicide**
   - Description: Refers to the practice where an object destroys or deletes itself, often invoking `delete this;`.

2. **Most Vexing Parse**
   - Description: A term describing an ambiguity in C++'s syntax where what looks like a function declaration is actually an object declaration with a function type.

3. **Rule of Three/Five/Zero**
   - Description: A set of rules governing how to correctly implement copy, move, and destruction semantics.

4. **SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error)**
   - Description: Describes the behavior in template metaprogramming where a failure in template argument substitution doesn't produce an error.

5. **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**
   - Description: A principle tying the acquisition of resources to the lifetime of an object.

6. **Copy Elision & RVO (Return Value Optimization)**
   - Description: Compiler optimizations that avoid unnecessary copy or move operations.

7. **ODR (One Definition Rule)**
   - Description: States that any given entity must have only one definition in the entire program.

8. **POD (Plain Old Data)**
   - Description: Classes or structs that don't have certain "non-trivial" behaviors, useful for C compatibility.

9. **UB (Undefined Behavior)**
   - Description: Parts of a program where the standard doesn't prescribe any behavior, leading to unpredictable results.

10. **CTAD (Class Template Argument Deduction)**
   - Description: Allows the compiler to deduce class template arguments automatically.

11. **Static Initialization Order Fiasco**
   - Description: The unpredictability of the initialization order of global/static objects across different translation units.

12. **Pimpl Idiom (Pointer to IMPLementation)**
   - Description: A technique hiding implementation details of a class from its interface.

13. **Friend Injection**
   - Description: When a class allows another class/function to access its private members.

14. **Two-Phase Name Lookup**
   - Description: How names in templates are resolved in two distinct phases.

15. **Zero-Cost Abstraction**
   - Description: Abstractions in C++ that donâ€™t impose a runtime cost.

16. **Narrowing Conversion**
   - Description: An implicit type conversion that may result in loss of information, such as converting a `double` to an `int`.

17. **Template Metaprogramming (TMP)**
   - Description: A technique in which templates are used by a programmer to generate compile-time computations or code structures.

18. **CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern)**
   - Description: A pattern where a class `X` is derived from a class template instantiation using `X` itself as template argument.

19. **Function Object (or Functor)**
   - Description: Objects that can be called as if they are functions, typically achieved by defining the `operator()`.

20. **Koenig Lookup (or Argument Dependent Lookup, ADL)**
   - Description: A name lookup rule that considers functions in the associated namespaces of the types of function arguments. For example, when you call a function on an object from a specific namespace, the compiler also looks in that namespace to find any functions that match the call, even if the namespace isn't explicitly mentioned in the code. This is particularly common with operator overloads. If you have a `std::vector` and use an operator on it that isn't defined in the current scope, the compiler will also check the `std` namespace because `std::vector` belongs to it.
