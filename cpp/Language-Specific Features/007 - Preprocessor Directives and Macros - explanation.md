# Preprocessor Directives and Macros
In the above code, we have demonstrated the use of preprocessor directives and macros in C++. We have defined a constant PI and a macro AREA using the #define directive. We then used these in our main function to calculate the area of a circle.

We also demonstrated the use of conditional compilation with the #ifdef and #ifndef directives. These directives allow us to include or exclude parts of the code based on whether a certain condition is met. In our case, we printed a message based on whether PI is defined or not.

Finally, we showed how to include files using the #include directive. This directive is used to include the contents of another file into the current file. In our case, we included the iostream file, which is necessary for input and output in C++.
