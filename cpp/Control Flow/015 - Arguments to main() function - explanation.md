# Arguments to main() function
In the above code, we are demonstrating the usage of arguments to the main() function in C++. The main() function can take two arguments: the number of command line arguments (argc) and an array of command line arguments (argv). 

The argc is always at least 1 because the name of the program itself is considered an argument. The argv is an array of character pointers where the first element (argv[0]) is the name of the program and the last element is a null pointer (argv[argc] = NULL).

The code prints the number of arguments and each argument. To see this in action, you would need to run the program from the command line and provide some arguments. For example, if you run `./program arg1 arg2`, the output would be:

```
Number of arguments: 3
Argument 0: ./program
Argument 1: arg1
Argument 2: arg2
```

This demonstrates that the program name is considered the first argument, and all subsequent arguments are those provided on the command line.
