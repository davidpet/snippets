# Local Variables Declared in Conditionals

This snippet demonstrates two concepts:

1. You can declare a variable in an `if` condition - the value assigned to the variable is the one checked.
   - this is similar to what goes on in your typical `for` loop

1. C++ 20 introduced `if-init` which lets you check a condition other than the default of true for nonzero
   - the present of `;` tells the compiler to check the condition
