# break and continue

The 'break' statement in C++ is used to exit the current loop or switch statement. It is often used in conjunction with conditional statements to exit a loop when a certain condition is met.

The 'continue' statement in C++ is used to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and immediately start the next iteration. It is often used in conjunction with conditional statements to skip certain iterations of a loop.

In the above code, we demonstrate the use of 'break' and 'continue' in both for and while loops. The 'break' statement is used to exit the loop when a certain condition is met (i or j equals 5), and the 'continue' statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop iteration when a certain condition is met (i or j equals 5). The numbers printed by the program demonstrate the effect of these statements on the loop iterations.
