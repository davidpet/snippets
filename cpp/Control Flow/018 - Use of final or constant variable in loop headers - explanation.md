# Use of final or constant variable in loop headers
In the above code, we first declare a constant integer `constInt` and use it in a loop header. The loop will iterate `constInt` times, printing numbers from 0 to 4. 

Next, we declare a 'final' integer `finalInt`. Note that in C++, the 'final' keyword is not used to declare final variables like in Java. In C++, once a variable is declared as 'const', it cannot be changed. We then use `finalInt` in a loop header. The loop will iterate `finalInt` times, printing numbers from 0 to 2.

This demonstrates the use of final or constant variables in loop headers in C++. The constant or final variable defines the number of iterations the loop will execute. Since these variables are constant, their values cannot be changed once they are initialized, ensuring the loop executes a fixed number of times.
