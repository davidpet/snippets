In C++, context management is not a direct feature of the language like it is in some other languages (like Python's `with` statement). However, we can achieve similar functionality using a combination of classes and the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) idiom. 

RAII is a common idiom used in C++ where resources are tied to object lifetime. That is, resource acquisition is done during object creation (initialization time), by the constructor, while resource deallocation is done during object destruction, by the destructor.

Here's an example of how we can use RAII to manage context:

#include <iostream>

// Define a class to manage the context
class ContextManager {
public:
    // Constructor
    ContextManager(const std::string& contextName) : name(contextName) {
        std::cout << "Entering context: " << name << std::endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~ContextManager() {
        std::cout << "Exiting context: " << name << std::endl;
    }

private:
    std::string name;
};

int main() {
    {
        ContextManager cm("Main Context");
        // When the ContextManager object goes out of scope, its destructor is called
        // This is where we can do any necessary cleanup
    }

    return 0;
}
