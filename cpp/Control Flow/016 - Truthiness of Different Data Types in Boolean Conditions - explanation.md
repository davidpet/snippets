# Truthiness of Different Data Types in Boolean Conditions
In the above code, we are demonstrating the truthiness of different data types in C++. The truthiness of a value in C++ is determined by whether the value is zero or non-zero. Zero values are considered false, while non-zero values are considered true. This applies to all data types, including integer types, floating point types, pointer types, and boolean types.

For integer and floating point types, any non-zero value is considered true. For pointer types, a null pointer is considered false, while a pointer that points to a valid memory location is considered true. For boolean types, the values `false` and `true` are considered false and true, respectively.

The ternary operator `? :` is used to print "True" if the condition is true and "False" if the condition is false. The `std::endl` is used to insert a new line after each print statement.
