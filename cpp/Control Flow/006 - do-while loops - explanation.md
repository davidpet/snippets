# do-while loops

1. The first part of the code demonstrates a basic do-while loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as the condition `counter < 5` is true. The `counter` variable is incremented within the loop, so eventually the condition becomes false and the loop stops. The expected output is:

```
Counter: 0
Counter: 1
Counter: 2
Counter: 3
Counter: 4
```

2. The second part of the code demonstrates a do-while loop where the condition is initially false. In this case, the code block within the loop is still executed once, but because the condition is false, the loop does not continue. Therefore, the line "This line will not be printed." is not actually printed.

3. The do-while loop is useful in situations where you want to ensure that a block of code is executed at least once, regardless of whether the condition is true or false. This is the main difference between a do-while loop and a while loop, which only executes the code block if the condition is true.
