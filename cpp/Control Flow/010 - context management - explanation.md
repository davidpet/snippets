# context management
In the above code, we define a `ContextManager` class. The constructor takes a context name and prints a message indicating that we're entering the context. The destructor prints a message indicating that we're exiting the context.

In the `main` function, we create a `ContextManager` object. As soon as the object goes out of scope (at the end of the block), its destructor is automatically called. This is the key to context management in C++: we can use the destructor to automatically perform any necessary cleanup when we're done with a context.

This is a simple example, but in a real-world application, the `ContextManager` class could manage more complex resources like file handles, network connections, or database transactions. The key is that the resource is automatically cleaned up when the `ContextManager` object goes out of scope, even if an exception is thrown, ensuring that resources are always properly managed.
