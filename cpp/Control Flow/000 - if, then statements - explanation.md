# if/then statements
The above code demonstrates the use of if/then statements in C++. 

1. The basic `if` statement checks a condition and executes the code block if the condition is true. In this case, it checks if the number is greater than 5.

2. The `if-else` statement checks a condition and executes the first code block if the condition is true, otherwise it executes the second code block. Here, it checks if the number is greater than 15.

3. The `if-else if-else` statement is used for multiple conditions. It checks each condition from top to bottom, and executes the code block for the first true condition. If none of the conditions are true, it executes the code block in the `else` clause. In this example, it checks if the number is greater than 20, then if it's greater than 10.

4. Nested `if` statements are `if` statements inside another `if` statement. The inner `if` statement only gets checked if the outer `if` statement's condition is true. Here, it first checks if the number is greater than 0, then if it's less than 20.
