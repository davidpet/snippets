## `static_assert` in C++

Introduced in C++11, `static_assert` provides a mechanism to perform compile-time assertions. This allows for the verification of conditions during compile-time, and if the condition fails, it produces a compile error with a given message.

### Key Features:

- Enables **compile-time checks**. It ensures certain conditions hold true at compile time, offering a way to catch potential issues before runtime.
  
- **Improves code readability**. By expressing constraints explicitly, it aids in conveying the author's intent and assumptions.
  
- The second argument is a **string literal message** which gets displayed if the assertion fails.

### Code Snippets:

1. **Using `static_assert` with type traits**:

    ```cpp
    #include <type_traits>

    template <typename T>
    void functionForIntsOnly(T value) {
        static_assert(std::is_integral<T>::value, "The function can only be used with integral types.");
        // ... function implementation ...
    }

    int main() {
        functionForIntsOnly(10);    // OK
        // functionForIntsOnly(10.5); // Compile error: The function can only be used with integral types.
    }
    ```

2. **Using `static_assert` to ensure certain conditions for a class**:

    ```cpp
    template <std::size_t N>
    struct FixedArray {
        static_assert(N > 0, "Size should be greater than 0.");
        int data[N];
    };

    int main() {
        FixedArray<10> validArray;
        // FixedArray<0> invalidArray; // Compile error: Size should be greater than 0.
    }
    ```

### Note:

- `static_assert` doesn't introduce any runtime overhead since the assertions are checked during compilation. It's purely a tool to enforce conditions that the programmer expects to be true.

With `static_assert`, C++ developers have a powerful tool to ensure compile-time invariants, thereby making code more robust and reducing potential bugs. It's especially valuable in template-heavy code where behavior can depend heavily on template arguments.
