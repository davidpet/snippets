# asserts

In the code, we demonstrate the use of `assert` in C++. `assert` is a macro that is used for debugging purposes to check if a certain condition is true. If the condition is false, the program will terminate and output an error message. 

In this example, we first assert that a variable `x` is equal to 10. Since this is true, the program continues and prints a message. We then assert that `x` is equal to 5. This is false, so the program terminates and the final print statement is not executed.

It's important to note that `assert` is removed when the code is compiled with the `NDEBUG` preprocessor directive defined. Therefore, it should not be used for handling runtime errors in production code. Instead, it's a tool for catching bugs during the development process.
