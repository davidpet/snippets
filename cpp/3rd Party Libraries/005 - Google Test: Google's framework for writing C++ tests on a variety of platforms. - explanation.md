# Google Test: Google's framework for writing C++ tests on a variety of platforms.
1. Google Test is a powerful tool for writing C++ tests. It provides a variety of macros to make assertions in your tests. In this example, we used `ASSERT_EQ`, which checks if two values are equal. If the assertion fails, the test will stop immediately. There are many other assertion macros available, such as `ASSERT_NE` (not equal), `ASSERT_LT` (less than), `ASSERT_LE` (less than or equal to), `ASSERT_GT` (greater than), `ASSERT_GE` (greater than or equal to), and `ASSERT_TRUE` (checks if a condition is true).

2. The `TEST` macro is used to define a test. The first argument is the test suite name, and the second is the test name within that suite. In this case, we have a test suite named "AdditionTest" and a test within that suite named "HandlesPositiveInput".

3. The `main` function initializes Google Test and runs all the tests. The `RUN_ALL_TESTS` function returns 0 if all the tests pass, and 1 otherwise. This allows you to use the return value in your build scripts or continuous integration server to determine if the tests passed.

4. This is a very basic example. Google Test provides many more features, such as test fixtures, death tests, value-parameterized tests, type-parameterized tests, and more. It also provides a way to control the output format, filter tests, repeat tests, and shuffle tests.
