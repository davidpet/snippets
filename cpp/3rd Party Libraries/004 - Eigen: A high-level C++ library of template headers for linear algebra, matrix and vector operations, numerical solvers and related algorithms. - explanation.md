# Eigen: A high-level C++ library of template headers for linear algebra, matrix and vector operations, numerical solvers and related algorithms.

1. The Eigen library is included at the beginning of the code. Eigen is a high-level C++ library of template headers for linear algebra, matrix and vector operations, numerical solvers and related algorithms.

2. A 3x3 matrix of integers is created using the `Eigen::Matrix3i` class. The `<<` operator is used to fill the matrix with values.

3. A dynamic size matrix and vector are created using the `Eigen::MatrixXd` and `Eigen::VectorXd` classes respectively. The `<<` operator is used to fill the matrix and vector with values.

4. Matrix and vector operations are performed using the `*` operator. The result is a dynamic size matrix.

5. Linear equations are solved using the `colPivHouseholderQr().solve()` function. The result is a dynamic size vector.

6. The `std::cout` statements are used to print the matrices, vectors and results of operations. The `<<` operator is used to send the matrices, vectors and results to the standard output stream.

7. The `std::endl` manipulator is used to insert a newline character and flush the output stream. This is done after each print statement to ensure that the output is displayed correctly.

8. The `return 0;` statement is used to indicate that the program has executed successfully.
