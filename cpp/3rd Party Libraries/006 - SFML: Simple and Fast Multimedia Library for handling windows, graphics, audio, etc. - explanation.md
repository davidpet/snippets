# SFML: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for handling windows, graphics, audio, etc.
This code demonstrates the basic usage of SFML for creating a window, loading a texture from a file, creating a sprite with that texture, and drawing it to the window. The main loop runs as long as the window is open, and it handles events (like the window being closed), clears the window, draws the sprite, and updates the window each iteration.

The `sf::RenderWindow` class is used to create a window that can be drawn to. The `sf::Texture` class is used to load a texture from a file, and the `sf::Sprite` class is used to create a drawable sprite with that texture.

The `sf::Event` class is used for event handling. In this case, we're only handling the `sf::Event::Closed` event, which is triggered when the window is closed.

The `window.clear()` function is used to clear the window with a specified color (in this case, black), and the `window.draw()` function is used to draw a sprite (or any other drawable object) to the window. Finally, the `window.display()` function is used to update the window with everything that has been drawn since the last call to `window.display()`.

Please note that you need to have an image file named "image.png" in the same directory as your executable for this code to run correctly. If the image file is not found or fails to load for any other reason, the program will exit with a return code of -1.
