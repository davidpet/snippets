# Qt: A comprehensive library for creating GUI applications.

This code creates a simple GUI application with a single button. When you run this application, you will see a window with a "Hello, world!" button.

1. `QApplication` is the class that manages the GUI application's control flow and main settings. It handles initialization and finalization, provides the event loop, and handles system-wide and application-wide settings.

2. `QPushButton` is a simple push button. The button's label is passed as a parameter to the constructor.

3. The `show()` method is used to display the widget. By default, a widget is not visible, so you must call this method to make it visible.

4. `app.exec()` starts the application's event loop. The event loop is where all the magic happens: it's a loop that waits for user input and reacts to it.

This is a very basic example, but Qt is a comprehensive library that provides a wide range of features for creating GUI applications, including dialogs, main windows, actions, menus, toolbars, status bars, dock widgets, and much more.
