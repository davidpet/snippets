# POCO: A collection of open-source C++ class libraries that simplify network-based, portable applications.
This code snippet demonstrates how to use the POCO C++ Libraries to create a simple HTTP client. The client sends a GET request to www.example.com and prints the response to the standard output.

The Poco::Net::HTTPClientSession class is used to establish a connection to the server. The Poco::Net::HTTPRequest class is used to create the HTTP request, and the Poco::Net::HTTPResponse class is used to handle the HTTP response.

The Poco::Net::HTTPClientSession::sendRequest method is used to send the HTTP request, and the Poco::Net::HTTPClientSession::receiveResponse method is used to receive the HTTP response.

The Poco::StreamCopier::copyStream method is used to copy the response stream to the standard output. This method takes two streams as arguments: the source stream and the destination stream. In this case, the source stream is the response stream, and the destination stream is the standard output.

The expected output of this program is the HTML content of the www.example.com homepage. The actual output may vary depending on the current content of the homepage.
