# Boost: Provides support for tasks such as multithreading, regular expressions, and unit testing.

1. The Boost.Thread library provides several classes that help manage threads in a C++ program. In this example, a worker function is created and run on a separate thread. The function simply sleeps for one second, then prints a message, five times in total.

2. The Boost.Regex library provides a flexible and powerful way to match regular expressions in strings. In this example, a regular expression is used to match any word in a string, and each match is printed on a new line.

3. The Boost.Test library provides a framework for writing and running unit tests. In this example, a test suite is created with a single test case. The test case checks that the sum of 3 and 2 equals 5, which is true, so the test passes.

4. The main function demonstrates the use of the worker function and the regular expression function. The unit tests are automatically run when the program is executed.
