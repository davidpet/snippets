Certainly! Here's a markdown explanation and a code snippet demonstrating the `std::starts_with` and `std::ends_with` functions for ## `std::starts_with` and `std::ends_with`

Introduced in C++20, the `std::starts_with` and `std::ends_with` member functions provide a convenient way to check if a string starts or ends with a specified substring or character.

**Output:**
```
s1 starts with Hello
s1 ends with World!
s1 starts with 'H'
```

These functions can simplify code by avoiding manual substring checks and make the intention of the code clearer.
