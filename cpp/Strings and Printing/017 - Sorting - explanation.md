# Sorting
1. The code begins by including the necessary headers: `iostream` for input/output operations, `string` for using the string class, `algorithm` for using the sort function, and `vector` for using the vector class.

2. A vector of strings is declared and initialized with some values.

3. The original vector is printed to the console.

4. The `std::sort` function is used to sort the vector in ascending order. The `begin()` and `end()` functions of the vector are used to specify the range to sort.

5. The sorted vector is printed to the console.

6. The `std::sort` function is used again to sort the vector in descending order. This time, a third argument is passed to `std::sort`: `std::greater<std::string>()`. This is a function object (also known as a functor) that defines the sort order. In this case, it sorts in descending order.

7. The sorted vector is printed to the console again, showing the result of the descending sort.

This code demonstrates the basic usage of the `std::sort` function for sorting strings in C++. It shows how to sort in both ascending and descending order.
