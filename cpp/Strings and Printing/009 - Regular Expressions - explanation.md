# Regular Expressions
1. The `std::regex` library in C++ provides support for regular expressions. Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and searching in strings.

2. The `std::regex_search` function is used to search for a pattern in a string. It returns true if the pattern is found anywhere in the string.

3. The `std::regex_match` function is used to check if the entire string matches the pattern. It returns true only if the entire string matches the pattern.

4. The `std::regex_replace` function is used to replace all occurrences of the pattern in the string with a replacement string.

5. The `std::smatch` object is used to store the results of a search or match operation. It can be iterated over to access all the matches.

6. The regular expression pattern "\\d+" matches one or more digits. The backslashes are escaped with additional backslashes because they are special characters in C++ strings.
