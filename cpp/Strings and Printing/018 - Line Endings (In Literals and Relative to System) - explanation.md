# Line Endings (In Literals and Relative to System)
In the above code, we demonstrate the use of different line ending characters in C++ string literals. The newline character (`\n`) moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line. The carriage return character (`\r`) moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line. The combination of newline and carriage return (`\r\n`) is used as a line ending in Windows systems. The form feed character (`\f`) moves the cursor to the beginning of the next page. The vertical tab character (`\v`) moves the cursor down to the next tab stop. The backspace character (`\b`) moves the cursor back one space. The null character (`\0`) is used to indicate the end of a string.
