# String Concatenation
In the above code, we demonstrate several ways to concatenate strings in C++. 

1. The '+' operator: This operator can be used to concatenate two strings. The result is a new string that is the combination of the two original strings.

2. The '+=' operator: This operator can be used to append a string to an existing string. The original string is modified to include the appended string.

3. The 'append' function: This function is a member of the std::string class and can be used to append a string to an existing string. Like the '+=' operator, the original string is modified to include the appended string.

4. Concatenating a string with a character array: The '+=' operator can also be used to append a character array to a string. The original string is modified to include the characters from the array.

5. Concatenating a string with a single character: The '+=' operator can also be used to append a single character to a string. The original string is modified to include the appended character.

Note that in all cases, the original strings are not modified unless the '+=' operator or 'append' function is used. In these cases, the original string is modified to include the appended string or characters.
