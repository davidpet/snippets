# String Splitting
In the above code, we first declare a string `str` and then use a string stream `iss` to split the string. The split strings are stored in a vector `results`. We then print each word in the string on a new line.

In the second part of the code, we demonstrate another way to split a string using the `getline` function. We declare a string `str2` and then use a string stream `tokenStream` to split the string by commas. The split strings are stored in a vector `results2`. We then print each programming language on a new line.

This code demonstrates two common ways to split a string in C++: using a string stream and using the `getline` function.
