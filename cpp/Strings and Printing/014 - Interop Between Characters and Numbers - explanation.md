# Interop Between Characters and Numbers
This code snippet demonstrates the interoperation between characters and numbers in C++. 

In C++, characters are internally represented as numbers according to the ASCII standard. This means that each character corresponds to a unique integer value. 

In the code, we first declare a character 'A' and print it. Then, we convert this character to its corresponding ASCII value (an integer) using `static_cast<int>()` and print this value. 

Next, we convert this ASCII value back to a character using `static_cast<char>()` and print the resulting character. 

Finally, we declare an integer '66', convert it to a character using `static_cast<char>()`, and print the resulting character. 

This demonstrates that in C++, we can easily convert between characters and their corresponding ASCII values (integers), and vice versa.
