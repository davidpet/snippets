# Comments (block, line, etc.)

In C++, there are two types of comments: single line comments and block comments. 

Single line comments start with two forward slashes (`//`) and continue until the end of the line. They are useful for short explanations or notes relevant to the code immediately beneath or beside them.

Block comments start with a forward slash followed by an asterisk (`/*`) and end with an asterisk followed by a forward slash (`*/`). They can span multiple lines, which makes them useful for providing more detailed information or for temporarily disabling a block of code.

All these types of comments are ignored by the compiler. This means that they do not have any effect on the execution of the program and are used solely for the purpose of making the code easier to understand and maintain.
