# Return Type Inference
In the above code, we have demonstrated the use of return type inference in C++. The `auto` keyword is used to let the compiler deduce the return type of a function from its return statements. This feature is particularly useful when working with templates or lambda functions, where the return type might not be known in advance.

The `simpleFunction` function returns an integer, so the compiler deduces its return type to be `int`. The `sum` function returns the sum of two numbers, so the compiler deduces its return type from the types of the numbers. The `makeLambda` function returns a lambda function, so the compiler deduces its return type to be a function that takes an `int` and returns an `int`.

In the `main` function, we call these functions and print their results to demonstrate that the return type inference is working correctly. The `simpleFunction` function returns `42`, the `sum` function returns `7` and `8.0` for integer and floating point inputs respectively, and the `makeLambda` function returns a lambda function that doubles its input, so it returns `10` when called with `5`.
