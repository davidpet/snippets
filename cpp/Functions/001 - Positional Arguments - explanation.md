# Positional Arguments
In the above code, we have demonstrated the use of positional arguments in C++ functions. 

The function `greet` takes two positional arguments: a string `name` and an integer `age`. When calling this function, we must provide these arguments in the same order as they are declared in the function definition.

The function `greetWithDefault` also takes two positional arguments, but these arguments have default values. If we call this function without providing any arguments, it will use the default values.

The function `printNumbers` takes three positional arguments of the same type. When calling this function, we must provide these arguments in the same order as they are declared in the function definition.

Positional arguments are a fundamental part of function calling in C++. They allow us to pass different values to a function each time we call it, making our functions more flexible and reusable.
