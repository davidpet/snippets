# Basic Syntax

In this code snippet, we have demonstrated the basic syntax of functions in C++. We have shown how to declare and define functions, how to call them, and how to use different types of parameters (regular, default, reference, and const). The functions are defined after the main function, but they are declared before the main function so that they can be called from within the main function. The 'const' keyword is used to indicate that a parameter cannot be modified within the function. The '&' symbol is used to indicate that a parameter is a reference, which means that the function operates on the original variable rather than a copy. This is demonstrated in the 'swap' function, which swaps the values of two variables.

Note: a __free function__ is the term for a function that is not a member of a class (not a method).
