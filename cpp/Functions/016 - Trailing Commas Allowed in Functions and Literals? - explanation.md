# Trailing Commas Allowed in Functions and Literals?
In C++, trailing commas are allowed in function parameter lists, initializer lists, and function calls. This can be useful for making code easier to modify in the future, as adding a new parameter or argument only requires adding a new line, not modifying an existing one.

In the code above, the function `printNumbers` has a trailing comma in its parameter list, and it is called with a trailing comma in the argument list. The function `getNumbers` returns a vector initialized with a trailing comma in the initializer list. All of these are valid syntax in C++. 

However, it's important to note that while this is allowed, it may be considered poor style by some programmers, as it can potentially lead to confusion. It's always a good idea to follow the coding style guidelines established by your team or project.
