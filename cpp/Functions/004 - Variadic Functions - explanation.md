# Variadic Functions
In the above code, we have demonstrated the use of variadic functions in C++. Variadic functions are functions which take a variable number of arguments. In C++, we use an ellipsis (...) to denote that a function can take any number of arguments.

The `va_list` is a type to hold the information about variable arguments. `va_start` is a macro which initializes the `va_list` to an argument list. The argument after `num` in the `va_start` macro is the last known fixed argument, meaning arguments after this are captured in ellipsis.

`va_arg` is a macro that expands to an expression that has the type and value of the next argument in the call. The argument arg must be the `va_list` and type must be the type name of the next argument passed to the function.

`va_end` is a macro that cleans up the setup provided for the `va_list`. It is usually called at the end of the function.

In the `main` function, we call the `add` function with different numbers of arguments to demonstrate the flexibility of variadic functions.
