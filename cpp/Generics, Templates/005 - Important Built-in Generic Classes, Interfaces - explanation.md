# Important Built-in Generic Classes/Interfaces
The above code demonstrates the use of some important built-in generic classes in C++, including `std::vector`, `std::map`, `std::set`, `std::queue`, and `std::stack`.

- `std::vector` is a dynamic array that can grow and shrink at runtime. It provides functions like `push_back()` to add an element at the end and `back()` to access the last element.

- `std::map` is a sorted associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys. It provides functions like `operator[]` to add a key-value pair and access the value associated with a key.

- `std::set` is a container that contains a sorted set of unique objects. It provides functions like `insert()` to add an element and `rbegin()` to access the last element.

- `std::queue` is a container adapter that provides a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure. It provides functions like `push()` to add an element at the end and `front()` to access the first element.

- `std::stack` is a container adapter that provides a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure. It provides functions like `push()` to add an element at the top and `top()` to access the top element.
