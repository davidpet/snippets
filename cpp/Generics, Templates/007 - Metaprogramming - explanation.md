# Metaprogramming
1. The `SimpleTemplate` class is a basic example of a template class in C++. It can hold a value of any type and has a method to print that value.

2. The `Factorial` struct is an example of template metaprogramming. It calculates the factorial of a number at compile time. This is done by recursively multiplying the number with the factorial of the number minus one. The recursion stops when the number is zero, at which point the factorial is defined to be one.

3. The `Factorial<0>` struct is a template specialization for the case when the number is zero. This is necessary to stop the recursion.

4. In the `main` function, we create instances of the `SimpleTemplate` class with `int` and `std::string` types, demonstrating that the class can work with any type. We also print the factorial of 5, which is calculated at compile time.

5. This code demonstrates the basics of templates and metaprogramming in C++. Templates allow for type-agnostic programming, while metaprogramming allows for computations to be done at compile time, potentially improving runtime performance.
