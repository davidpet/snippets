# Custom Comparators for Elements
In the above code, we have demonstrated the use of custom comparators in C++ templates. We have defined two custom comparators, `DescendingOrder` and `AscendingOrder`, which are used to sort a vector of integers in descending and ascending order respectively.

The `sortVector` function is a template function that takes a vector and a comparator as arguments. The comparator is used to sort the vector. This function demonstrates how to use a custom comparator in a template function.

In the `main` function, we create a vector of integers and sort it in descending and ascending order using the `sortVector` function and the custom comparators. The sorted vectors are then printed to the console. The expected output is commented at the end of the print statements.
