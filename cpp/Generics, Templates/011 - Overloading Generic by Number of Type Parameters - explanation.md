# Overloading Generic by Number of Type Parameters
In the above code, we have a function template `printValues` that is overloaded by the number of type parameters. The function `printValues` is overloaded three times to handle one, two, and three parameters respectively. 

When we call `printValues` with different numbers of arguments in the `main` function, the appropriate overloaded version of the function is selected based on the number of arguments. 

This demonstrates how you can overload function templates in C++ by the number of type parameters. This is a powerful feature of C++ templates that allows you to create functions that can handle different numbers and types of arguments.
