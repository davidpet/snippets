C++ does not have a direct equivalent to type wildcards as seen in languages like Java. However, C++ templates can be used to achieve similar functionality. Here is an example of how you might use templates to create a function that can accept arguments of any type:

#include <iostream>

// A template function to demonstrate the concept of type wildcards
template <typename T>
void print(const T& value) {
    std::cout << value << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    print(5); // prints: 5
    print(3.14); // prints: 3.14
    print("Hello, World!"); // prints: Hello, World!
    return 0;
}

In the above code, `T` is a placeholder for any type. When you call the `print` function with an argument of a certain type, the compiler generates a version of the function that works with that type.

C++ templates can also be used with classes:

template <typename T>
class Box {
public:
    Box(T value) : value(value) {}

    void print() const {
        std::cout << value << std::endl;
    }

private:
    T value;
};

int main() {
    Box<int> intBox(5);
    intBox.print(); // prints: 5

    Box<double> doubleBox(3.14);
    doubleBox.print(); // prints: 3.14

    Box<std::string> stringBox("Hello, World!");
    stringBox.print(); // prints: Hello, World!

    return 0;
}

In this example, `Box` is a template class that can store a value of any type. The `print` member function prints the value.

C++ templates are a powerful feature that allow you to write generic code that works with any type. However, they are not exactly the same as type wildcards in other languages. In C++, the type is determined at compile time, not at runtime. This means that you cannot, for example, create a `Box` that can hold either an `int` or a `double`. Each `Box` can only hold one type of value.
