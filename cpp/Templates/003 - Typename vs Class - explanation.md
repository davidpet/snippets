# Typename vs. Class

All the examples in here use `typename` for the template type argument.  In that context, `class` and `typename` are interchangeable.  `class` has existed for longer, but it was confusing because things that aren't classes, such as `int`, can be used there.  `typename` is considered more readable.

Note: there is another use of `typename` within the body of template code that is separate from this issue and covered later.
