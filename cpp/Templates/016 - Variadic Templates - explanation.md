# Variadic Templates

Variadic templates are a feature of C++ that allow you to define functions, classes, and structures that take a variable number of template arguments. This is achieved using the ... ellipsis notation.

The first example demonstates a variadic function tempalte, and the second demonstrates a variadic class template.

This MyTuple class is a simple and incomplete version of what's available as std::tuple in the C++ Standard Library.

Variadic templates offer a lot of flexibility, and these examples are just the tip of the iceberg. With more complex manipulations and utilities (like std::index_sequence and fold expressions in C++17), you can perform sophisticated operations on variadic template parameters.
