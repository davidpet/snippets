# Typename in Body

Certainly! The `typename` keyword is used inside template functions (and classes) to indicate that a name represents a type. This is particularly useful in contexts where dependent names are used.

A dependent name is a name used in a template definition that is dependent on a template parameter and thus isn't resolved until the template is instantiated. The C++ compiler cannot determine on its own if such a name represents a type or a value, so we use `typename` to indicate it's a type.

In the `printSize` function, `T::ValueType` is a dependent name because it depends on the template parameter `T`. By using `typename` before it, we tell the compiler that `ValueType` is a type and not a static member or some other entity.
