## Template Aliases in C++

Introduced in C++11, template aliases provide a way to create shorter, more descriptive names for potentially complex template types. Essentially, they're a mechanism to give a new name to an existing type.

### Why Use Template Aliases?

1. **Readability:** They make the code cleaner by reducing the verbosity of complex types.
2. **Flexibility:** They can simplify changes in underlying data structures.
3. **Easier Refactoring:** Changing the implementation details doesn't necessarily involve changing the alias users.

### Syntax:

```cpp
template<typename T>
using NewName = SomeTemplate<T>;
```

### Points to Remember:

- **Not a New Type:** A template alias doesn't introduce a new type. It's just a new name for an existing type.
  
- **Variadic Template Aliases:** Just like with template classes and functions, you can create aliases that work with variadic templates.
  
- **Multiple Levels:** You can create aliases of aliases if needed.

Template aliases are a powerful way to make template-heavy C++ code more readable and maintainable, simplifying complex type definitions into more easily digestible forms.
